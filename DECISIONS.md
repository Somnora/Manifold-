# Decisions

A running log of non-obvious architectural and implementation choices: what
was decided, what the alternatives were, and why. Written for someone
learning backend development. Newest entries at the bottom.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Verify the Lambda API from its OpenAPI spec, not blog posts

**Decided:** Implement `RealLambdaClient` against the machine-readable spec at
`https://cloud.lambda.ai/api/v1/openapi.json` (v1.10.0), and record the facts
we depend on in `lambda_api.py`'s docstring.

**Alternatives:** Trust tutorials/HOWTOs, or the older
`cloud.lambdalabs.com` domain (it now 301-redirects; the spec marks it
deprecated).

**Why:** API details drift, and this project's error handling hangs on exact
strings — e.g. capacity failures are identified by the error code
`instance-operations/launch/insufficient-capacity` inside an
`{"error": {code, message, suggestion}}` envelope. Reading the source of
truth once beats debugging a mystery later. Lesson: when a vendor publishes
an OpenAPI spec, treat it as the contract.

## 2026-07-10 — Interfaces + injected dependencies at every external boundary

**Decided:** Three seams, each an abstract interface with a real and a mock
implementation: `LambdaClient` (Lambda API), `StorageClient` (S3 adapter),
and the `connect_fn` hook inside `ManagedConnection` (SSH dialing).
`create_app()` accepts any of them as arguments.

**Alternatives:** Call `httpx`/`boto3`/`asyncssh` directly where needed and
monkeypatch in tests; or use a mocking library like `responses`/`moto`.

**Why:** The project rule is "no live spend during development" — the whole
test suite and the dashboard must run against fakes. An explicit interface
makes the fake a first-class citizen (the mock dashboard mode uses the same
`MockLambdaClient` as the tests) instead of test-only patch magic. It also
documents exactly which slice of each vendor API we use.

## 2026-07-10 — Launch endpoint returns 202 immediately; the pipeline runs in the background

**Decided:** `POST /instances` does validation and guard checks synchronously
(so rejections are instant and explicit), then persists a `launches` row and
runs retry → boot-wait → SSH-connect as an `asyncio` background task. Clients
poll `GET /launches/{id}` to watch `launching → retrying → booting → active`
(or `failed`, with the error message preserved).

**Alternatives:** (a) Block the HTTP request until the instance is live —
but capacity retries plus booting can take many minutes, and browsers/proxies
time out. (b) A job queue like Celery/Redis — banned by the stack rules and
overkill for a single-user local tool.

**Why:** The status lives in SQLite, so retry progress survives page reloads
and is trivially renderable by the dashboard ("never fail silently"). This is
the standard "accepted for processing" pattern behind HTTP 202.

## 2026-07-10 — Guards compute against LIVE Lambda state, not our database

**Decided:** The concurrency and budget guards list instances from the Lambda
API at request time and sum `price_cents_per_hour` over everything still
billable (`booting`/`active`/`unhealthy`).

**Alternatives:** Track running instances in SQLite and check that.

**Why:** Our DB only knows about launches made through Manifold. If an
instance was launched from Lambda's own console (or a previous Manifold run
crashed), a DB-based guard would happily overspend. The API is the source of
truth for money; our DB is just history. Costs one extra API call per launch.

## 2026-07-10 — Plain stdlib sqlite3 behind a lock, not an ORM or async driver

**Decided:** `db.py` uses `sqlite3` with `check_same_thread=False`, one
`threading.Lock`, WAL mode, and hand-written SQL.

**Alternatives:** SQLAlchemy (ORM), aiosqlite (async driver).

**Why:** This is a single-user local tool writing a few rows per launch;
every statement runs in microseconds, so briefly blocking the event loop is
harmless. An ORM adds a dependency and a layer of indirection to learn for
five queries. If contention ever appears, swapping in aiosqlite is contained
in one file. Boring and readable wins.

## 2026-07-10 — ConnectionManager = "where to dial" and nothing else

**Decided:** The `ConnectionManager` interface has exactly one method,
`dial_target(instance) -> host`. `direct-ssh` returns the public IP;
`tailscale` (Phase 3) will return the tailnet IP. Everything above the dial —
`ManagedConnection`, terminals, forwards, rsync — is shared code that never
branches on mode.

**Alternatives:** Subclass the whole connection stack per mode, or sprinkle
`if mode == "tailscale"` through the codebase.

**Why:** The spec demands the mode be "a swap point only". Making the
interface one method wide makes violations impossible to hide: if a feature
needs anything mode-specific beyond the address, the design is wrong and the
compiler-of-code-review catches it. Small interfaces are how you keep a swap
point honest.

## 2026-07-10 — One supervisor task per SSH connection; reconnect forever with capped backoff

**Decided:** `ManagedConnection.start()` spawns a supervisor coroutine:
connect, wait for the connection to close, reconnect with exponential backoff
(base 1s doubling to a 30s cap), repeat until deliberately closed. Instance
lifecycle ("active" per Lambda) and connection state ("connected" per us) are
tracked and displayed separately.

**Alternatives:** Reconnect only on demand when a command fails; give up
after N reconnect attempts.

**Why:** GPU boxes reboot, networks blip, and sshd comes up a beat after the
instance reports "active". A supervisor gives one place where state
transitions happen, which makes the dashboard's connection badge trustworthy.
We never give up because the fix for "instance is really gone" is
termination, which closes the connection object — not a silent timeout that
leaves a zombie card. The capped backoff keeps a dead host from being hammered.

## 2026-07-10 — Retry semantics: one attempt = one pass through (type + fallbacks)

**Decided:** Per attempt, try the requested type, then each fallback in
order; only `insufficient-capacity` moves to the next candidate. Between
attempts, exponential backoff (5s base, 120s cap), max 5 attempts. Any
non-capacity error fails the launch immediately. Fallbacks that would break
the budget guard are dropped at admission time, before the row is created.

**Alternatives:** Exhaust all 5 retries on the primary type before touching
fallbacks (slower to get a GPU); treat all errors as retryable (hides real
problems like quota or bad parameters behind minutes of pointless retries).

**Why:** The user's intent is "give me a usable GPU soon, prefer this type" —
cycling candidates each round gets capacity fastest while preserving
preference order. Budget-filtering fallbacks up front keeps the guard
absolute: no code path launches an over-budget type. The launched type and
its real hourly rate are recorded separately from the requested type, so cost
history stays honest.

## 2026-07-10 — `known_hosts=None` for instance SSH (trade-off, revisit)

**Decided:** The managed connection accepts the host key of a freshly booted
instance without verification.

**Alternatives:** Pin host keys by fetching them via the Lambda API (not
offered), or TOFU-persist the first-seen key per instance.

**Why:** A brand-new cloud instance has a brand-new host key, so there is
nothing to check it against on first contact; strict checking would just
break every launch. Persisting the first-seen key per instance id (proper
TOFU) is cheap hardening once instance identity matters — noted for Phase 3
when cloud-init could report the key out-of-band.

**Closed 2026-07-11:** see the TOFU host-key pinning entry below.

## 2026-07-11 — TOFU host-key pinning (closes the `known_hosts=None` debt)

**Decided:** `HostKeyStore` (`host_keys.json` next to the database, gitignored)
pins the host key presented on the FIRST connect to each host; every
reconnect must match the pin or the connect fails with an explicit
"host key changed" error. The orchestrator forgets a host's pin whenever the
instance is terminated (both Manifold-initiated and external terminations
detected at reconcile).

**Alternatives:** Fetching keys out-of-band via cloud-init (more moving
parts, and the sidecar channel itself rides SSH — circular); pinning per
instance id instead of per host (asyncssh validates by host, and the
supervisor reconnect loop only knows the host).

**Why:** First contact is unavoidably trust-on-first-use for a fresh cloud
instance, but everything after it need not be — reconnects are where a
long-lived supervisor would silently accept a swapped identity. Forgetting
pins at termination matters because Lambda recycles public IPs: a stale pin
would wrongly reject the next tenant of the address. Backend shutdown does
NOT forget pins (the instances keep running), so a backend restart
re-verifies against the original keys.

## 2026-07-10 — Billing timestamps: `launched_at` vs `active_at`

**Decided:** The `launches` table records both when Lambda accepted the
launch (`launched_at` — billing starts here) and when the instance became
reachable (`active_at`). Cost history uses `launched_at → terminated_at`.

**Alternatives:** One timestamp for "started".

**Why:** Lambda bills from launch acceptance, including boot time. Computing
cost from `active_at` would systematically undercount by a few minutes per
launch. Small thing, but the History page's numbers should survive
comparison with the real invoice.

## 2026-07-10 — App is built by a factory; uvicorn runs it with `--factory`

**Decided:** No module-level `app` object. `create_app()` takes settings and
injected clients; `create_default_app()` reads `MANIFOLD_MOCK` and is run as
`uvicorn app.main:create_default_app --factory`.

**Alternatives:** The common `app = FastAPI()` at module scope.

**Why:** A module-level app would construct the real Lambda client at import
time, so merely importing `app.main` (as every test does) would demand
credentials. The factory pattern keeps construction explicit, makes tests
first-class (each test builds its own app with mocks), and gives mock mode a
clean switch. Rule of thumb: side effects at import time eventually bite.

## 2026-07-10 — S3 adapter specifics worth writing down

**Decided:** `S3AdapterStorage` dials `https://files.<region>.lambda.ai`,
uses the filesystem's UUID (`id`) as the bucket name, and sets boto3's
checksum calculation/validation to `when_required`.

**Why:** All three facts come from Lambda's S3-adapter docs and are easy to
get wrong: the bucket is NOT the filesystem's human name, and without the
checksum settings newer boto3 versions send checksum headers the adapter
answers with `NotImplemented`. Recording them here saves the next debugging
session.

## 2026-07-10 — Dashboard polls the backend; no websockets, no data library

**Decided:** Client components fetch from the backend on a 2-5s interval via
one small `usePolling` hook. No SWR, no react-query, no websocket layer for
page state. Plain `fetch` with typed wrappers in `lib/api.ts`.

**Alternatives:** SWR/react-query (dependency for caching we don't need on a
localhost API with tiny payloads); server-sent events or websockets (real
push, but a second transport to build and debug before Phase 3 actually
needs one for telemetry streaming).

**Why:** The backend already persists every state transition, so polling
`GET /instances` + `GET /launches` renders the truth within two seconds —
good enough for a human watching a launch. Fewer moving parts now; the
websocket work arrives in Phase 3 where it pays for itself (live GPU
telemetry). Rule applied: add realtime transport when the data is realtime,
not for status badges.

## 2026-07-10 — The launch form contains zero rules

**Decided:** The form does not pre-validate region matches or budgets. It
auto-fills the region when a filesystem is picked (pure convenience, still
editable) and submits whatever the user chose; backend rejection messages
are displayed verbatim.

**Alternatives:** Duplicate the guard logic client-side for instant feedback.

**Why:** Project rule — guards live beneath all clients, and clients contain
no business logic. Duplicated validation drifts: the day the backend guard
changes, a client-side copy would lie. Showing the backend's own message
also proves at demo time that the dashboard and any future MCP agent hit the
identical wall.

## 2026-07-10 — Capacity-retry demo via env var, not a demo endpoint

**Decided:** `MANIFOLD_MOCK_CAPACITY_FAILURES=N` (mock mode only) scripts N
insufficient-capacity errors into the mock client at startup.

**Alternatives:** A `/debug/fail-next-launch` endpoint; a magic instance
name that always fails.

**Why:** Failure injection stays in process wiring, not in the API surface —
a debug endpoint would be one more thing clients could hit and one more
branch in production code. The env var reuses the same `scripted_launch_errors`
mechanism the tests use, so the demo exercises the exact code path the test
suite covers.

## 2026-07-10 — SSH key is chosen per launch, validated against Lambda's registry

**Decided:** `GET /ssh-keys` lists the account's registered key names; the
launch form offers them in a dropdown, `POST /instances` takes an optional
`ssh_key_name`, and `config.yaml`'s `ssh.key_name` is only the fallback
default. The orchestrator rejects (400) any key name not registered with
Lambda before calling the launch API.

**Alternatives:** Config-file-only (original Phase 1 design — user feedback:
"nowhere to enter the SSH information"); free-text input (invites typos that
would surface minutes later as a launch failure).

**Why:** The key must exist in Lambda's registry for the launch call to
succeed, so the honest UI is a dropdown of exactly those names. Validating
membership at admission keeps failures at the cheap end of the pipeline.
Note the private key path for the backend's own SSH client remains in
config.yaml; only the key NAME travels with a launch.

## 2026-07-10 — No prices on the Instances page (user decision)

**Decided:** The launch form and instance cards show GPU identity
(description like "1x A10 (24 GB PCIe)") and no hourly prices. The budget
guard still runs on live API prices; the History page keeps its cost column
(a spec deliverable) computed from Lambda-reported rates.

**Why:** Owner feedback at Gate 2: the mock-mode canned prices read as wrong
data, and the cards' job is tracking which GPU is which, not accounting.
Prices remain in the API responses so guards and history stay honest; the
dashboard just stops advertising them where they add noise.

## 2026-07-10 — Post-mortem: orphaned dev servers and a stale .next cache

**What happened:** Demo servers started in the background were never
actually killed (shell job tables do not survive between tool invocations),
so port 8000 was still taken when the owner ran the backend ("address
already in use"), and a `next build` ran while the orphaned dev server had
`.next` open — the mixed cache produced "module not found in the React
Client Manifest" errors on every page.

**Rule going forward:** kill dev processes by port (`lsof -ti :8000 :3000 |
xargs kill`), never by job id; and if dev-server behavior looks impossible,
`rm -rf .next` before deeper debugging.

## 2026-07-11 — Sidecar ships inside cloud-init, not fetched at boot

**Decided:** `build_user_data()` embeds the sidecar's source verbatim in the
cloud-init script (heredoc into /opt/manifold), runs it under systemd as a
loopback-only service.

**Alternatives:** Fetch from a URL at boot (needs somewhere public to host
it, plus a supply-chain surface); scp it after SSH comes up (adds a
provisioning step that can race jobs).

**Why:** The sidecar is one file far under Lambda's 1 MB user-data cap. What
an instance runs is exactly what this commit contains, the instance needs no
extra credentials or network fetch, and the version question ("which sidecar
is on that box?") answers itself: the one the launching backend shipped.

## 2026-07-11 — Tailscale dial target is the MagicDNS hostname

**Decided:** A tailscale-mode launch names the instance `manifold-<launch_id>`,
cloud-init joins the tailnet with that hostname (`tailscale up --ssh
--hostname=...`), and `TailscaleConnectionManager.dial_target()` returns the
instance name. The contract test asserts both managers expose exactly
{mode, dial_target} — nowhere for mode-specific logic to hide.

**Alternatives:** Query the tailnet for the node's 100.x.y.z IP via the
local `tailscale` CLI or Tailscale's API (extra dependency and credentials;
the IP is just what MagicDNS resolves anyway).

**Why:** The orchestrator host is on the tailnet, so the hostname resolves
like any other address — dialing a name keeps the swap point one line and
zero new dependencies. asyncssh does not care whether it dials an IP or a
name; everything above the dial stays byte-identical.

## 2026-07-11 — Safety hook is evidence, not a lock

**Decided:** `terminate(force=False)` asks the sidecar for unpersisted
ephemeral files and blocks with the file list (HTTP 409) if any exist. But
if the sidecar is unreachable — instance still booting, connection down,
orphan instance launched outside Manifold — termination proceeds.

**Alternatives:** Refuse to terminate whenever the check cannot run.

**Why:** The hook's job is preventing accidental data loss, not preventing
termination. A hard requirement would make an unhealthy or half-booted
instance unkillable from the dashboard while it bills by the minute — a
worse failure than losing scratch files the user was warned are ephemeral.
force=true remains the explicit override either way, and sync-then-terminate
is the safe path the dashboard offers first.

## 2026-07-11 — Telemetry: WS to the browser, polling over the SSH forward

**Decided:** The browser gets a real WebSocket from the backend
(`/instances/{id}/metrics/stream`). Behind it, `RealSidecarClient` polls the
sidecar's GET /metrics through a per-call SSH local port forward every 2s,
rather than holding a second long-lived WS through the tunnel.

**Alternatives:** Proxy the sidecar's own WS end-to-end through the forward
(same data rate, but a long-lived forward + WS client to supervise through
every SSH reconnect).

**Why:** The payload is a few hundred bytes every 2 seconds; polling over
the already-supervised managed connection delivers identical freshness with
one less stateful thing to babysit. The sidecar keeps its WS endpoint (it
costs nothing and a future client may want it); the browser-facing contract
is a WS either way, so swapping the internals later touches one class.

## 2026-07-11 — Template placeholders validated at load, ports forced to loopback

**Decided:** Templates are validated when loaded, not when run: every
`{{placeholder}}` in a command must be a declared parameter, every host
mount must start with `/workspace/ephemeral` or `{persistent}`, and declared
ports are published on 127.0.0.1 by the dispatcher regardless of what the
template says. Broken templates are surfaced in GET /templates' `errors`
map instead of silently vanishing.

**Why:** Load-time failure puts the error in front of the person editing
YAML, not the person dispatching a job hours later. The loopback rule is
enforced in the dispatcher (one place) rather than trusted to each template,
consistent with "nothing on the instance listens publicly except sshd."

## 2026-07-11 — Tasks validate twice: at enqueue and at dispatch

**Decided:** `POST /tasks` runs the template's parameter validation
immediately (bad requests fail with 422 at the door), and the dispatcher
re-runs it before rendering the docker command.

**Alternatives:** Validate only at dispatch (a typo sits silently in the
queue until an instance connects, maybe minutes later); only at enqueue
(the template YAML can change between enqueue and dispatch).

**Why:** The person is present at enqueue time — that is when an error is
cheap. The dispatch-time recheck covers the gap where a template was edited
or deleted while tasks were queued. Same principle as the launch guards:
fail at the earliest moment the failure is knowable.

## 2026-07-11 — One task at a time; a running task pins the instance

**Decided:** The dispatcher runs a single task at once, and the idle loop
skips entirely while any task is running. Idle = connected + no running
task + no activity (job or terminal) for the timeout, with the clock seeded
at connection time and reset by every dispatch/completion.

**Alternatives:** Concurrent tasks per instance (GPU contention chaos for
no benefit at max_concurrent_instances=1); counting time-since-last-log as
activity (a long quiet training epoch would read as idle — wrong).

**Why:** Serialized tasks match the one-GPU-instance reality and make logs,
idle logic, and failure attribution trivially understandable. The
"running task = alive" rule is the conservative one: better to keep a box
an hour too long than kill a fine-tune at 90%.

## 2026-07-11 — Idle termination reuses the safety hook, then syncs, then forces

**Decided:** Idle auto-termination calls the standard `terminate(force=False)`.
If the Phase 3 hook blocks (unpersisted files), the dispatcher syncs
ephemeral → persistent and retries with force=true; every step lands in the
audit log (demonstrated live at the gate: idle_termination → idle_sync →
terminated in one trace).

**Alternatives:** Idle-terminate with force=true directly (defeats the whole
point of the hook — unattended termination is exactly when data loss
happens); block and wait for a human (the machine bills all night).

**Why:** Unattended is when the safety hook matters most, and sync-then-
terminate is the only resolution that needs no human. The files end up in
`<filesystem>/ephemeral-backup/`, the box stops billing, and the audit log
tells the story next morning.

## 2026-07-11 — Capacity watches: notify by default, auto-launch double-gated

**Decided:** (James's feature request at Gate 3.) `POST /watches` registers
an instance-type + region watch; the dispatcher polls the catalog and flips
the watch to "available" when capacity appears. Auto-launch requires BOTH
`auto_launch` on the watch AND `watches.auto_launch_enabled: true` in
config.yaml, and goes through `request_launch` — budget, concurrency, and
region guards all apply (test-proven: an over-budget auto-launch watch sees
capacity but is refused, with the rejection audited).

**Alternatives:** Notify-only (capacity at 3am is gone by 8am — the user
called this "a game changer" precisely because reacting manually loses the
race); auto-launch by default (spending money unattended should need two
deliberate switches, not one checkbox).

**Why:** The double gate splits "what I want" (per watch) from "what I
permit" (global config), so an experimenting user cannot accidentally
arm unattended spending. Routing through the normal launch pipeline means a
watch can never become a guard bypass.

## 2026-07-11 — Terminal protocol: JSON control frames in, raw text out

**Decided:** The browser terminal WS sends JSON messages
(`{type: "input"|"resize", ...}`) and receives raw text frames of terminal
output. The backend bridges to an asyncssh PTY session
(`create_process(term_type=..., term_size=...)`) on the managed connection.

**Alternatives:** Binary frames both ways with a framing byte (what ttyd
does — more efficient, more code); running ttyd/gotty on the instance
(banned: nothing may listen publicly except sshd, and a web terminal
service is exactly the kind of thing that gets left running).

**Why:** Two message kinds do not justify a binary protocol on a localhost
link. Raw-text-out means the server needs no envelope parsing on the hot
path, and xterm.js consumes it directly. The mock shell sits behind the
identical bridge code — only the dialed connection object differs — so the
gate demo exercises the real WS handler, not a lookalike.

## 2026-07-11 — Mock shell instead of a local Docker container for the gate demo

**Decided:** `MockSSHConnection.create_process()` returns a tiny scripted
shell (prompt, echo, canned nvidia-smi/claude outputs). The Gate 5 demo and
tests drive the real WS bridge against it.

**Alternatives:** Run a local sshd container and have the backend really
SSH into it (closer to production, but adds a Docker dependency to the test
suite and still would not have a GPU, so nvidia-smi would fail anyway).

**Why:** The thing worth testing is Manifold's bridge: WS handling, PTY
plumbing, resize propagation, activity touching, teardown. That code is
byte-identical in mock and real mode. What a real sshd would additionally
prove (asyncssh's own PTY support) is upstream-tested. Real-instance
verification happens at the manual phase gate like every other phase.

## 2026-07-11 — Recent-files view: bounded sidecar walk, not inotify

**Decided:** (For James's "see files being added/moved/produced" ask.) The
sidecar's GET /storage/recent walks ephemeral + persistent roots, returns
files modified in the last N hours (default 24), newest first, hard-capped
at 20k entries scanned / 50 returned, with a `truncated` flag. Dashboard
polls it every 5s while the Files panel is open.

**Alternatives:** inotify/watchdog for true event streaming (persistent
storage is NFS, where inotify does not see remote writes — it would
silently miss exactly the files jobs produce); rsync --list-only diffing
(stateful, more moving parts).

**Why:** A bounded mtime walk is stateless, works identically on NFS, and
5-second freshness is plenty for "is my job producing outputs?". The scan
cap keeps a million-file HF cache from wedging the sidecar; the truncated
flag keeps the cap honest instead of silent.

## 2026-07-11 — TAO support is a template, not a feature

**Decided:** NVIDIA TAO Toolkit support ships as `templates/tao-train.yaml`
(task entrypoint + spec file + results dir, all on persistent storage), not
as dedicated backend/frontend code.

**Why:** This is the Gate 4 design paying rent: "TAO made easy" required
zero code because templates are data. The same holds for the next toolkit
James wants — the answer is a YAML file. If a workflow ever genuinely needs
new capability (e.g. multi-node), that is when code gets written.

## 2026-07-11 — MCP thinness is enforced by an import-allowlist test, not review

**Decided:** `mcp_server.py` may import exactly `os`, `typing`, `httpx`,
and the MCP SDK — a test parses the module's AST and fails on anything
else. The module lives in the same package as the backend for packaging
convenience (`manifold-mcp` console script), but structurally it can only
speak HTTP to the backend.

**Alternatives:** A separate package/venv for true physical isolation
(more honest still, but adds a second lockfile and install step to a
single-user local tool); code review as the enforcement mechanism (decays
the first time someone adds "just one" convenience import).

**Why:** "The MCP server is a thin client with no path around guards" is
the spec's hard rule; a rule is only real if a machine checks it. The AST
test turns an architectural intention into a failing build. Guard parity
is additionally proven behaviorally: the same over-budget launch through
the dashboard's HTTP path and the MCP tool returns byte-identical
rejection text.

## 2026-07-11 — MCP tools return errors as data, not protocol exceptions

**Decided:** Backend rejections come back to the agent as
`{"error": <the backend's exact detail>}` (plus `blocked` +
`unpersisted_files` for the termination hook) rather than raised MCP
errors. Every tool takes an optional `note`, and every call — success or
rejection — is POSTed to `/audit/agent` and shown on the Agent Activity
page. Audit posting is best-effort: an unreachable backend already failed
the real call, so a failed audit write must not mask the real error.

**Alternatives:** Raise protocol-level errors (clients render them
inconsistently, and several truncate the message — the guard's dollar math
is the most useful part); make audit writes mandatory (turns a logging
hiccup into a tool failure the agent then retries, double-logging).

**Why:** An agent that can read "Budget guard: … would bring hourly spend
to $22.32, over the $4.00 limit" can explain to its human exactly why it
stopped, or pick a cheaper GPU. Error-as-data with the backend's own words
keeps agents and humans looking at the same truth; the audit trail makes
the agent's whole session reviewable after the fact.

## 2026-07-11 — Phase 7: first-run setup through the dashboard

**What happened:** James started real mode with no .env; the backend
crashed at import of the real client and the dashboard showed blank
dropdowns with no explanation. Root cause: credentials were file-only and
the failure mode was silent.

**Decided:** Three pieces. (1) Real mode without a key now boots into an
`UnconfiguredLambdaClient` — every Lambda-backed endpoint returns 503 with
"No Lambda API key configured. Open the dashboard's Settings page…", and
the Instances page shows a banner linking to Settings. (2) A Settings page
accepts the key once, the backend VALIDATES it against the live Lambda API
before saving (an invalid key is rejected with Lambda's own message and
never persisted), writes it to .env preserving comments, and (3) hot-swaps
the running client through a `SwappableLambdaClient` wrapper — the launch
form goes live without a restart.

**Alternatives:** Keep .env-only setup with better docs (still fails the
"someone without Lambda knowledge" test); store secrets in SQLite or
browser localStorage (violates the secrets-live-in-.env rule and secret
hygiene — the browser never holds the key, it passes through one POST and
is never echoed back); require a restart after saving (simpler, but the
first-run experience should end with a working launch form, not another
terminal step).

**Why:** The dashboard is the product's front door; the first five minutes
should not require knowing what dotenv is. Validation-before-save turns
"why are my dropdowns empty an hour later" into "Lambda rejected this key"
at paste time. Secret hygiene held: booleans and counts in /settings/status,
key never logged, never audited, never returned.

## Phase 8 — reconnect-on-startup (2026-07-11)

**What:** On startup the backend calls `orchestrator.adopt_running_instances()`,
which lists live Lambda instances and re-establishes a `ManagedConnection` to
any that are `active` with an IP and not already tracked. Connection mode comes
from the launch history row, falling back to `default_connection_mode` for
instances launched outside Manifold.

**Why:** Before this, restarting the backend orphaned every running instance —
it kept billing on Lambda but the dashboard showed it `disconnected` with no way
to reconnect, forcing a terminate-and-relaunch. Surfaced live when a wrong SSH
key (config pointed at `id_ed25519` instead of the launch key) left an instance
stuck `reconnecting`; the only recovery was a restart, which then orphaned it.

**Design:** Best-effort — an unconfigured or unreachable Lambda client logs and
returns 0 rather than blocking boot (a startup hook must never crash the app).
Reuses the exact launch-path connection code via a shared `_open_connection`
helper, so an adopted connection is byte-identical to a freshly launched one
(same terminal, telemetry, idle detection). Adoptions are audited.

**Alternatives considered:** Persisting connection objects across restarts
(impossible — SSH sockets don't survive a process). Storing "last known
instances" in SQLite and trusting it (rejected: Lambda is the source of truth;
an instance may have been terminated out-of-band, so we must re-list live).

## Phase 9 — guided launch form + full region catalog (2026-07-11)

**What:** The launch form now walks GPU -> region -> filesystem. GPUs list
available types first (cheapest to priciest), out-of-capacity ones greyed and
unselectable. Region options are driven by the chosen GPU: regions with
capacity for it are selectable (a region where you already have a filesystem
wins ties), the rest are greyed with "not available for this type". Filesystem
narrows to the selected region. Added the full 12-region NA catalog with human
names (Virginia, Arizona, ...) and a `GET /regions` endpoint serving the whole
region universe so the form can grey out what a GPU can't use.

**Why:** James kept building invalid combinations (a us-east-1 filesystem with a
region the GPU wasn't in, or picking a region blindly) and hitting backend
rejections after the fact. Mirroring Lambda's own console flow — pick the GPU,
then see only the regions that GPU can actually run in — makes the invalid
combination unrepresentable in the UI. The backend guards stay the final
authority; this just stops the user reaching them by accident.

**Design:** `/instance-types` shape is unchanged (WatchPanel still consumes it);
region names live in a separate `/regions` endpoint so nothing breaks. Native
`<select>` with `disabled` options does the greying — no custom dropdown,
matches the console, stays readable. Auto-selection fills sensible defaults
(cheapest available GPU; a region where a filesystem exists) but never fights
an explicit choice.

## Phase 10 — in-dashboard chat with a served model (2026-07-11)

**What:** A Chat button on connected instance cards. `GET
/instances/{id}/model` reports whether a model server is live (a running
task whose template publishes a port — vllm-serve today) and which model.
`POST /instances/{id}/chat` relays an OpenAI-style chat completion to the
model's loopback port over an SSH local port forward and streams the SSE
response straight through to the browser. New `ModelClient` seam
(real = per-call port forward + httpx streaming, mock = canned SSE chunks),
mirroring `SidecarClient` exactly.

**Why:** James's original vision: download a HuggingFace model and talk to
it inside the dashboard. vllm-serve already served the model on the
instance's loopback; this adds the one missing hop, browser -> backend ->
SSH forward -> vLLM, without opening any new listener anywhere.

**Design choices:**
- Discovery, not registration: "a model is being served" is derived from
  the task queue (running task + template with ports), so there is no
  separate serving state to drift out of sync. Kill the job, chat closes.
- The relay passes vLLM's SSE bytes through untouched instead of
  re-encoding: the browser parses the standard OpenAI chunk format, and
  mid-stream failures are surfaced as a data: {"error": ...} event rather
  than a silently truncated reply.
- Chat traffic counts as activity (touch_activity per chunk), and a
  serving task already pins the instance alive via the running-task rule,
  so a conversation can't be idle-terminated mid-reply.
- Every chat call is audited (instance, message count, model) — message
  CONTENT is deliberately not logged.
- Known quirk: vllm-serve's `port` parameter changes the container port
  while the loopback mapping stays 8080:8080; chat uses the host side of
  the mapping, which is what the dispatcher actually publishes, so it
  works regardless. Cleaning up that parameter is cosmetic backlog.

## Phase 11 — Autopilot: a self-hosted model drives Manifold (2026-07-11)

**What:** Agent runs. Pick a brain (any instance serving a model via
vllm-serve), give a goal, and the backend runs the loop: send conversation
to the brain over the managed SSH connection -> expect ONE JSON action ->
execute it against Manifold's own guarded operations -> feed the observation
back. GPU A literally manages GPU B. New Autopilot page shows every run and
step live, with cancel; steps also land in Agent Activity under actor
"autopilot". Also: instances terminated out-of-band are now reconciled away
(card dropped, SSH supervisor reaped, history row closed), and the dashboard
marks stale data as stale when the backend stops answering (James hit both).

**Why this shape (the honest version):**
- A strict one-JSON-action-per-turn protocol instead of OpenAI tool-calls:
  vLLM's native tool-call support varies wildly by model; plain JSON is the
  thing 7B-class open models can reliably produce, and parse errors are
  bounced back as correction hints (3 consecutive failures end the run).
- The loop lives IN the backend, next to the guards, not in a client:
  launch_gpu IS orchestrator.request_launch, so budget/concurrency/region
  guards bind the autopilot with zero new enforcement code. Test-proven:
  an over-budget launch comes back as {"error": "Budget guard: ..."} data
  the model reads and adapts to.
- Caps everywhere: hard step ceiling (config autopilot.max_steps_cap),
  wait cap, per-turn chat timeout, MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES, fixed action
  allowlist (no shell, no arbitrary HTTP, no self-modification). Runs are
  cancellable; orphaned runs are marked failed at startup.
- Honest limits, stated in docs: a 7B open model is a mediocre long-horizon
  agent. The harness compensates (tiny action space, errors-as-data, hard
  caps), and the same guarded surface is what a heavyweight brain (Claude
  via MCP) uses for hard jobs. Autopilot is the self-sufficient tier, not
  the only tier.

**Alternatives:** LangChain/agent frameworks (dependency ban, and the loop
is ~200 lines); letting the agent shell into instances (unbounded blast
radius — refused); OpenAI-native tool calling (model-dependent, brittle on
small models).

## Phase 12 — File Bridge: SFTP over the managed connection, not S3 (2026-07-11)

**What:** Upload/download between this machine and an instance, everywhere:
POST /instances/{id}/files/upload (multipart) and GET .../files/download
(streamed), riding SFTP on the managed SSH connection. Dashboard: Upload
button + per-file Download links in the Files panel. MCP: upload_file /
download_file tools (auto-select when exactly one instance is connected),
so agents can round-trip artifacts. Paths are jailed to /lambda/nfs/ and
/workspace/ephemeral/ (normpath, then prefix check — traversal rejected);
relative paths land on the instance's persistent filesystem. Transfers are
audited and count as activity for idle detection.

**Why SFTP, not the S3 adapter:** the adapter exists only in a few regions
(James's Virginia filesystem has none), needs separate keys, and the SSH
connection is already supervised. SFTP works in every region with zero new
credentials. The S3-based Storage page stays for browse/delete without an
instance; the bridge requires a connected instance, which is honest — the
persistent filesystem is only reachable through one.

**Also:** sdxl-generate reference template. Its Python lives in a static
PYCODE env var and parameters arrive as argv, keeping the dispatcher's
shell-quoting at the top level of the command — the pattern for future
script-in-container templates (nested quoting is where injection bugs
breed). A 404 on download is detected by pulling the first SFTP chunk
BEFORE the response starts, so missing files are a real 404 rather than a
broken 200 stream.

## Phase 13 — OpenAI-compatible /v1 proxy (2026-07-11)

**What:** GET /v1/models and POST /v1/chat/completions (streaming +
non-streaming) at localhost:8000. Any OpenAI client — the openai SDK,
OpenClaw, IDE assistants — points its base_url at Manifold and talks to a
model served on an instance. Routes by the request's `model` (instance id,
then exact model id, then a lenient single-model fallback) to the serving
instance; the completion rides the managed SSH connection. Verified live
against the real `openai` Python SDK (models.list, chat, streaming).

**Why non-streaming got its own ModelClient method:** for stream=false we
POST to vLLM with stream=false and return its response object verbatim —
real `choices` and `usage` — rather than reassembling from SSE chunks
(which drops usage and risks a lossy reconstruction). stream=true relays
vLLM's SSE bytes untouched. Passing every other OpenAI param straight
through means temperature/top_p/stop/max_tokens all just work; the only
field we rewrite is `model`, forced to the real served id so vLLM accepts
it (this is what makes the lenient single-model route work for tools with a
hardcoded model name).

**Why the proxy launches nothing / has no budget guard of its own:** it
only reaches models ALREADY running, whose vllm-serve launch already
cleared the budget and concurrency guards. Cost is the instance's hourly
rate, already governed; there is no per-token spend to guard. Proxy use
touches idle-activity so a model in use isn't idle-terminated.

**Auth:** optional bearer via MANIFOLD_PROXY_KEY (.env, secret). Empty =
open, correct for the localhost-only default; set it before exposing the
backend past localhost. Errors are OpenAI-shaped ({"error": {message,
type, code}}) so real clients render them properly.

**Alternatives:** a full pydantic model for the request (rejected — the
OpenAI surface is wide and evolving; a permissive pass-through of the raw
JSON is more compatible and less brittle); reassembling non-streaming
responses from the stream (rejected — loses usage, more code, faithful
pass-through is simpler and correct).

## Post-13 — Model readiness probe: "serving" vs "ready" (2026-07-11)

**Problem (found in a next-move audit):** chat, the OpenAI proxy, and
autopilot all treated a model as usable the instant its vllm-serve task was
'running'. But that task goes running when the CONTAINER launches, while
vLLM then spends minutes pulling the image, downloading weights, and
loading the GPU before its API answers. On real hardware the dashboard
would advertise a model as available and every call would get
connection-refused for minutes — three features looking broken on first
real use.

**Fix:** `Dispatcher.model_ready(instance_id, task_id, port)` probes GET
/v1/models on the instance (via the previously-unused
`ModelClient.model_info`) and caches the verdict with a TTL — short (3s)
while loading so the UI flips promptly, long (30s) once ready. Every
model-using path now gates on it: `/instances/{id}/model` reports
serving + ready + status_detail; chat returns 503 "still loading" instead
of a connection error; `/v1/models` lists only ready models (a client
picking from the list can always use it); `/v1/chat/completions` returns a
clean 503 model_loading; autopilot refuses to start on a loading brain; the
chat panel shows a loading state and the autopilot brain picker only offers
ready models.

**Why a TTL cache, not a background loop:** the probe opens an SSH forward,
so doing it on every request (the chat panel polls every 5s) would be
wasteful; a background loop would probe instances nobody is looking at. On-
demand with a TTL probes only what's actually being used, at most once per
window. Keyed by task_id so a fresh serve gets a fresh verdict.

## Phase 14 — File Navigator: browse/sizes/delete on the sidecar, archive over SFTP (2026-07-11)

**What:** A real file browser on the instance card (Browse button): breadcrumb
navigation over both volumes, a Sizes lens (recursive per-child totals,
heaviest first — the "what is eating my filesystem" cleanup view James asked
for), delete with a type-of-guard (directories require recursive=true and a
UI confirmation; roots are never deletable), upload-into-this-folder, per-file
download, and whole-directory download as one .tar.gz.

**Where the logic lives, and why:** listing/usage/delete are SIDECAR endpoints
(/fs/list, /fs/usage, /fs/delete) rather than SFTP walks from the backend. The
sidecar runs on the box: os.scandir against local disk/NFS is orders of
magnitude faster than per-entry SFTP round trips from a laptop, the recursive
usage walk is bounded (MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES + truncated flag, same pattern as
/storage/recent), and the real implementation gets unit-tested against a temp
directory instead of a dict pretending to be a filesystem. Path jailing is
enforced INSIDE the sidecar (resolve + parent check against its roots), so the
backend relay cannot be tricked into escaping even if its own checks regressed.
Trade-off: new sidecar endpoints only exist on instances launched after this
commit — acceptable because instances are ephemeral by design.

**Archive:** tar.gz runs ON the instance (tar czf to a hashed temp under
/workspace/ephemeral/.manifold-archives), streams down over the existing SFTP
read path, temp removed after — compression happens where bandwidth is cheap,
and one click fetches a whole outputs directory instead of N file downloads.

**Gotcha recorded:** with `from __future__ import annotations`, a pydantic
model defined INSIDE create_app silently becomes a query parameter (FastAPI
resolves annotation strings via module globals) — request models in the
sidecar must live at module level. Found by the 422 in tests.

## Phase 15 — Data pipeline: script-run + llm-synthesize (2026-07-11)

**What:** Two templates that compose into James's scrape->synthesize
workflow. `script-run`: run any Python script from <filesystem>/scripts
with the whole persistent filesystem mounted rw at /data (requirements.txt
auto-installed; args passed as ONE shell-quoted string — argv[1] — keeping
the dispatcher's injection guard intact). `llm-synthesize`: map an
instruction over every JSONL/CSV record using the model served on the SAME
instance, writing {"record", "synthesis"} lines to synthesized/<name>.jsonl,
with a `limit` param for cheap quality checks before full runs. Plus
docs/data-pipeline.md (the candidate-research worked example).

**The enabling change — `network: host` for templates:** a synthesize
container must call vLLM, which another job publishes on the HOST's
127.0.0.1 — unreachable from Docker's default bridge (host-gateway only
reaches 0.0.0.0 binds). Templates may now declare `network: host`,
validated at load (only "" or "host"; mutually exclusive with `ports`,
since host networking has no mappings). Consistent with the hard rule:
host networking lets a container DIAL loopback; it creates no listener.
The synthesize->vLLM hop never leaves the box.

**Why stdlib-only PYCODE:** the synthesize script uses urllib/csv/json, so
python:3.11-slim starts in seconds with no pip step, and the model id is
auto-discovered from /v1/models rather than asked of the user twice.

**Never-run-template guard:** test_llm_synthesize_pycode_actually_runs
executes the template's embedded Python for real against a stub OpenAI
server (JSONL in, structured JSONL out, progress lines checked). The
sdxl-generate lesson: a template whose script has never executed is a bug
that ships silently.

## 2026-07-11 — Job exit codes: `set -o pipefail` in the dispatch wrapper

**Decided:** The remote command wrapper (`wrap_remote_command`) sets
`set -o pipefail` before piping container output through `tee`.

**Alternatives:** Drop the tee (lose the persistent on-instance log copy);
capture `PIPESTATUS[0]` after the fact (bash-only anyway and more moving
parts).

**Why:** A pipeline's exit code is the LAST command's. Ours ended in `tee`,
which always exits 0, so every job reported "succeeded" regardless of what
the container did. Found at the first real-hardware gate: two vllm-serve
jobs that crashed in seconds (GGUF repo, unsupported by vLLM) showed green,
and the llm-synthesize that then had no model to call showed green too.
Mock SSH always returns exit 0, which is exactly why the tests never caught
it — so the regression test executes the real wrapper in a real bash
(`test_wrap_remote_command_propagates_container_exit_code`), same lesson as
the never-run-template guard.

## 2026-07-11 — Idle auto-termination: 30 min default + per-instance switch

**Decided:** `idle.timeout_seconds` default moves 300 -> 1800. The instance
card shows the idle countdown, and a per-instance "Keep alive" switch
(persisted on the launch row, `keep_alive` column) disables idle
auto-termination entirely until switched back.

**Alternatives:** Keep 300s (cheap but hostile to interactive sessions); a
global on/off toggle (all-or-nothing loses the cost protection); pausing
the timer on dashboard polling (would make merely LOOKING at the dashboard
keep instances alive — too magical).

**Why:** During live testing the 5-minute timeout terminated the instance
mid-session between two manual steps; the user experienced it as data loss
("the instance totally disappeared"). Cost protection stays on by default,
but the user can now SEE the countdown before it acts and opt an instance
out explicitly. Terminal and job activity still reset the clock; the audit
log records both the switch and every idle termination.

## 2026-07-11 — llm-synthesize: preflight wait + resilient mapping (Phase 17)

**Decided:** The synthesize script (a) validates the input path up front,
(b) polls /v1/models until the served model actually answers (bounded by
MANIFOLD_SYNTH_READY_TIMEOUT, default 300s) instead of calling it once, (c)
retries a transient per-record error twice, (d) tolerates a malformed input
line by skipping+counting it rather than dying, and (e) parses JSON replies
(including ```json fences) into a `synthesis_json` field, flagging non-JSON
with `parse_error`.

**Alternatives:** Keep the thin one-shot script and rely on the operator to
sequence serve→ready→synthesize perfectly by hand (this is exactly what
failed at the first live gate — synthesize was queued against a model that
had crashed, and it died on a raw urllib traceback); parse JSON downstream
on the user's machine (defeats "synthesize into usable points seamlessly").

**Why:** The pipeline's value is that a cloud GPU feels self-sufficient; a
stage that crashes the instant timing is imperfect, or that hands back
double-encoded strings, breaks that. Every branch is covered by executing
the REAL embedded script against a configurable stub vLLM (never-run-guard
extended to eight cases: happy path, fenced JSON, prose, wait-for-ready,
retry, malformed input, missing input, no-model-fail-fast).

## 2026-07-11 — script-run: runner in an env var (fixes a quoting collision)

**Decided:** script-run's logic moved into a RUNNER env var invoked as
`bash -c "$RUNNER" manifold {{script}} {{args}}`, receiving script and args
as positional params ($1, $2). It also preflights that the script exists
(fail fast, exit 2, clear message) and caches pip downloads under
/data/.cache/pip on persistent storage.

**Alternatives:** Keep the inline `bash -c 'cd /data && ... python
scripts/{{script}} {{args}}'` wrapper.

**Why:** The inline wrapper was a latent bug. render_docker_command
shlex-quotes each {{param}} for a TOP-LEVEL shell context, but the params
were substituted INSIDE a single-quoted `bash -c '...'` string — so
`{{args}}`'s own single quotes collided with the wrapper's, e.g.
`bash -c '... python ... '--state TX''` fractures the argument. The mock SSH
only echoes, so no test caught it; the moment a real scraper passed args
with a space, argv would split wrong. The env-var/positional pattern (the
same one llm-synthesize already uses for PYCODE) keeps every substituted
value at the top level where shlex-quoting is correct. Caught by the new
execute-the-real-runner test, which asserts args-with-spaces arrive as one
argv[1]. Same never-run-template lesson, now applied to the scrape stage.

## 2026-07-11 — Sidecar diagnosis over the SSH channel

**Decided:** A read-only diagnostic (`app/diagnostics.py`,
`GET /instances/{id}/sidecar/diagnose`, "Diagnose" button on the telemetry
panel) probes the instance over the managed SSH connection when the sidecar
HTTP is silent, and classifies the cause: cloud-init still running,
cloud-init error, sidecar crashed (with the journal tail), sidecar starting
(up but not yet listening on 9411), or a transient forward failure (healthy
on the instance).

**Alternatives:** Leave the dead-end "sidecar not reachable yet" message;
add more retries to the forward (treats the symptom, not the cause).

**Why:** At the first live gate telemetry showed "not reachable yet" 13
minutes after boot with no way to tell whether cloud-init, the service, or
the SSH forward was at fault. The managed SSH connection is known-good when
this happens (the card shows "connected"), so the instance can be asked
directly. The probe is pure and injectable — classification is unit-tested
against canned probe outputs, so the logic is verified without hardware;
the live session confirms the root cause. Read-only shell only; it opens no
new listener and rides the one channel already trusted.

## 2026-07-11 — Model presets + model-id normalization (vllm-serve UX)

**Decided:** A curated catalog (`app/model_catalog.py`, `GET /model-presets`)
of ungated, VRAM-tiered models shown as click-to-fill chips under the
vllm-serve model_id field. The dashboard also normalizes model_id on submit:
a pasted `huggingface.co/owner/model` URL is reduced to `owner/model`, and
trailing whitespace/punctuation is trimmed.

**Alternatives:** Live HuggingFace API (browse trending) — a network
dependency and far more surface for a first version; free-text id only (the
status quo, which let a stray trailing ";" reach vLLM as part of the repo
id and fail the serve).

**Why:** "Is the model id all we need?" plus a fat-fingered `;` in the field
showed the id box is the friction point. Presets remove the typo path for
common models and answer "recommend by GPU" via the tier badge (A10 24GB vs
H100 80GB) without heavy plumbing. Presets are ungated on purpose so a first
serve needs no HuggingFace token; gated models (Llama, Gemma) need token
passthrough, deferred. The URL/trim normalization directly answers "would
pasting the URL be easier?" — now both work.

## 2026-07-11 — Job History: active/finished split with removal

**Decided:** The Jobs page splits Active (queued/running) from History
(succeeded/failed). Finished jobs can be removed one at a time
(`DELETE /tasks/{id}`, refused for a running job) or cleared in bulk
(`DELETE /tasks/finished`); both drop the task and its logs. Route order
puts the literal `/tasks/finished` before `/tasks/{task_id}`.

**Alternatives:** Keep one flat queue (what shipped) — finished jobs from
past sessions accumulate forever with no way to clear; auto-expire old
tasks (surprising, and history is sometimes worth keeping).

**Why:** Tasks persist in SQLite across instances and sessions (correct), but
the flat "Queue" list mixed a fresh failure with week-old successes and had
no clear affordance. Splitting active from history matches how the user
reasons ("what's running now" vs "what happened"), and explicit removal
keeps deletion a deliberate act. A running job cannot be removed, so history
cleanup can never orphan a live container.

## 2026-07-11 — Sidecar deps must target the service's interpreter

**Decided:** cloud-init installs the sidecar's deps with
`/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages fastapi uvicorn
pynvml` (with a bare-pip retry and a non-fatal fallback), and ensures pip
for that interpreter first — matching the `ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3` the
systemd unit uses.

**Alternatives:** The old `python3 -m pip install ...` (bare); a virtualenv
for the sidecar (more moving parts on a single-file service); shipping the
sidecar as a container (heavier, and it needs host pynvml/NVML anyway).

**Why:** Strongly suspected root cause of the recurring "sidecar not
reachable yet" seen on every instance. On Lambda ML images `python3` in
root's PATH is often conda's, so a bare `pip install` puts fastapi/uvicorn
where `/usr/bin/python3` cannot import them; the service then crash-loops
(Restart=always) and never listens on 9411, so telemetry AND the file
browser (both sidecar-backed) fail together. Targeting /usr/bin/python3
explicitly, plus PEP 668 handling for newer Ubuntu, closes all three
plausible failure modes at once. Cannot be exercised without live spend, so
the guard is an invariant test: the fastapi install line must start with
`/usr/bin/python3 -m pip` and never regress to a bare `python3`. The new
Diagnose button confirms it on the next launch (service active + listening).

## 2026-07-11 — NVIDIA runtime configured every boot (fixes 126 on all jobs)

**Decided:** cloud-init runs `nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker`
+ `systemctl restart docker` UNCONDITIONALLY (was gated inside
`if ! command -v nvidia-ctk`), adds `ubuntu` to the docker group, and runs a
boot self-test (`docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda ... nvidia-smi -L`)
whose verdict lands in /var/log/manifold-init.log.

**Alternatives:** Keep the gate (what shipped); configure the runtime at
image-build time (we do not build the image).

**Why:** Every job — even the trivial gpu-smoke — failed with exit 126
("OCI runtime create failed") once exit codes became honest. Root cause: the
runtime-configure step lived inside the toolkit-install guard, but Lambda
images SHIP the toolkit, so the guard was skipped and a freshly
get.docker.com-installed docker was never wired to the NVIDIA runtime;
`docker run --gpus all` then failed on every GPU job. The pre-pipefail tee
bug had masked this as "succeeded" since the beginning — GPU jobs never
actually ran. Configure is idempotent, so running it unconditionally is
safe; the boot self-test makes the next diagnosis instant (read the init log
from the in-app Terminal).

## 2026-07-11 — script-run env_file: API keys for scrapers

**Decided:** script-run takes an optional `env_file` param (a path on the
filesystem, e.g. `research/.env`); the runner sources it (`set -a; . "$ef";
set +a`) before the script runs, failing fast if the named file is absent.

**Alternatives:** Bake keys into the script (leaks into git); pass keys as
job parameters (they would show in the audit log and job card); a secrets
store (over-engineered for a single-user local tool).

**Why:** Research scrapers need API keys (news, FEC, etc.). Uploading a .env
to the persistent filesystem via Browse and naming it keeps secrets on the
instance's NFS, out of git and out of the job record, while the script reads
them from the environment as usual. Verified by executing the real runner
with a temp .env and asserting the variable reaches the script.

## 2026-07-11 — Connection reliability: keepalive + per-command timeout

**Decided:** The managed SSH connection sets `keepalive_interval=15s,
keepalive_count_max=3` (drop a silent link in ~45s), and
`ManagedConnection.run()` enforces `ssh.command_timeout_seconds` (default
120s) via `asyncio.wait_for`, with sync/archive passing a longer 600s bound
and job dispatch passing `timeout=None` (it streams for hours).

**Alternatives:** Rely on the OS TCP timeout (~15 min to notice a dead
path); no command ceiling (a stalled NFS mount wedges the request until the
client aborts).

**Why:** Best explanation for "backend errors appearing periodically" in
live testing. Without keepalive, a silently-dropped TCP path leaves the
supervisor showing CONNECTED for ~15 min while every sidecar/model/file call
hangs then 30s-aborts on the dashboard. Keepalive turns that into a ~45s
detect-and-reconnect. Separately, a command with no ceiling can hang
forever on a stalled mount; a bounded run fails just that call and leaves
the supervised connection up (a truly dead link is caught by keepalive, not
by wedged commands). A timeout raises ConnectionError, which callers already
handle as "couldn't run it."

## 2026-07-11 — Short-TTL cache on list_instances, with a guard bypass

**Decided:** `SwappableLambdaClient` caches `list_instances` for 2s,
invalidated on any launch/terminate WE initiate and on credential swap. The
concurrency/spend guard calls `list_instances(fresh=True)`, which always
hits the API and refreshes the cache.

**Alternatives:** No cache (every 2s dashboard poll — times N tabs, plus MCP
and capacity watches — hits Lambda's rate-limited API, a plausible source of
periodic 429s); cache without a guard bypass (two launches ~1s apart could
both read a stale "0 running" and both pass, doubling spend under a
max_concurrent=1 cap).

**Why:** The read path (dashboard view, reconcile) tolerates ≤2s staleness —
it already polls at that cadence — and invalidation-on-mutation means any
action taken through Manifold shows up immediately; only out-of-band console
changes wait out the TTL. The spend guard is the one caller where staleness
costs money, so it bypasses the cache unconditionally. The bypass is a
`fresh` kwarg on the LambdaClient interface (ignored by non-caching
implementations), keeping the guard's data source explicit at the call site.

## 2026-07-11 — Instance panels survive transient reconnects (no more flap)

**Decided:** InstanceCard latches `everConnected` once the SSH state first
reaches "connected", and gates the action buttons AND the terminal/files/
browse/chat/telemetry panels on that latch instead of the live
`connection_state`. The card still disappears when the instance leaves the
list (terminated).

**Alternatives:** Keep gating on the live state (what shipped); add
auto-reconnect to each panel's socket (more code, and a fresh shell loses
state anyway).

**Why:** During a heavy load (downloading a ~15 GB model), the supervisor
can briefly flip CONNECTED → reconnecting → CONNECTED. Gating on the live
value unmounted and remounted the whole control row on every blip — the
"terminal kept disappearing and reappearing" the user reported. Latching
keeps the UI stable; each panel already surfaces its own connection status,
so a real drop is still visible without tearing the card apart. Complements
the Phase 20 keepalive, which makes those flips rarer in the first place.

## 2026-07-11 — Claude CLI on PATH; honest model-loading copy

**Decided:** cloud-init adds `~/.local/bin` to PATH via
`/etc/profile.d/manifold-path.sh` and `.bashrc`, so `claude` resolves in a
fresh Open Terminal shell. The chat panel's loading state reframes the
readiness-probe error as expected-while-downloading and points to the job
Logs for real progress.

**Why:** The Claude installer warned "~/.local/bin is not in your PATH", so
the CLI it just installed wasn't runnable without manual PATH surgery. And
the chat panel surfaced the raw probe error ("Server disconnected without
sending a response") while a model was merely still downloading (VRAM 0.4/22
GiB confirms it never loaded), which reads as a crash. Both are honesty/UX
fixes, not behavior changes: PATH makes the pre-installed tool usable, and
the copy tells the user what's actually happening instead of alarming them.
(Interactive Claude sign-in on a headless box remains manual — that is
inherent, not something cloud-init can pre-solve.)

## 2026-07-11 — Finding: reconnect_on_startup is genuine restarts, not over-logging

**Investigated (Prompt A):** Agent Activity showed dozens of near-identical
`reconnect_on_startup` rows, ~one per minute.

**Finding:** NOT over-logging. The event is emitted in exactly one place —
`Orchestrator.adopt_running_instances()` (orchestrator.py), guarded by
`if adopted:` — and that method is called from exactly one place: the
FastAPI `lifespan` startup handler (main.py), once per process start. There
is no loop and no repeated call; grep confirms a single call site. Each row
therefore corresponds to a real backend restart that genuinely re-adopted a
running instance.

**Root cause of the frequency:** the dev server runs with `--reload` (see
CLAUDE.md). During active development every save to a `backend/app/*.py`
file restarts the process, and each restart legitimately re-adopts the
still-running instance and writes exactly one audit row. With a live
instance and a burst of edits (shipping several phases), that is dozens of
honest restarts. In production (no `--reload`) it fires once per real start.

**Decision:** do NOT change the emit — it is correct (once per actual
startup, only when something was adopted). Two changes instead: (1) the
Agent Activity UI collapses consecutive identical events into one counted
row with a time range, so N restarts read as "reconnect_on_startup ×N,
9:34–9:42", and (2) a note in CLAUDE.md that `--reload` restarts are
expected during development. Behavior unchanged; only the display and the
docs.

## 2026-07-11 — Cost estimation + right-size hint: median history, VRAM-keyed threshold

**Context (Prompt C):** show a pre-launch cost/runtime estimate for a job,
and a post-run utilization verdict with an optional "you could use a smaller
GPU" hint. Everything here is presentational and advisory: it reads existing
SQLite (launches, tasks) plus a new lightweight telemetry table, and never
touches the launch/termination path. It recommends; it never overrides a GPU
choice.

**Estimate — median of same template + same GPU type.** `estimate_job`
(estimates.py, a pure function) takes the durations of past *succeeded* runs
of this template on this instance type and reports the **median** minutes,
priced at the type's hourly rate (`minutes/60 * rate`).

- Median, not mean: run times are right-skewed (one stuck run at 4x the
  norm shouldn't drag the estimate up). The median is robust to that.
- Confidence tiers, surfaced in the UI so the number is never oversold:
  - `>= 3` matching runs -> **measured** (`MEASURED_MIN_RUNS = 3`).
  - `1-2` runs -> **rough** ("still learning"): real data, but too little
    to trust as a median.
  - `0` runs -> **rough**, falling back to a coarse per-template default
    (`DEFAULT_MINUTES`) explicitly labeled "no history yet".
  - Server templates (vllm-serve) have no fixed runtime -> **none**: we show
    "runs until you stop it, $X/hr" instead of a fake total.
- Timing is *already* persisted (task started_at/finished_at), so estimates
  sharpen automatically as history accrues. Nothing new to record for this.

**Right-size hint — keyed on PEAK VRAM, not average utilization.** The single
most important safety property: **a false "downsize" that OOMs the next run
destroys trust**, so the hint is deliberately hard to trigger.

- We key on **peak VRAM used / total VRAM**, because VRAM is what actually
  OOMs a job. Average SM utilization can look low on a memory-bound job that
  still needs every GB, so utilization is *shown* but never gates the hint.
- Threshold `RIGHT_SIZE_VRAM_FRACTION = 0.45`: the hint fires only if peak
  VRAM stayed at or below 45% of the card. Rationale: at <=45% peak, the job
  fits with room to spare on a card roughly half the size, so a smaller tier
  is genuinely plausible. A **gray zone** of 0.45-0.65 says "some headroom"
  but makes **no** downsize call, because a run peaking near 60% could exceed
  a half-size card once inputs grow. Above 0.65 the card was well used and we
  say nothing.
- Minimum evidence `MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_HINT = 5`: with fewer than 5 telemetry
  samples we refuse to call it ("limited telemetry"). A job could spike VRAM
  in a window we didn't sample; a handful of readings can't rule that out.
- The hint always names the observed peak and stays advisory ("you *could*
  try a smaller GPU"), never an instruction. Manifold does not change the
  selection.

**Telemetry persistence.** The verdict needs history, and metrics were
previously live-only. Added a `telemetry_samples` table and a dispatcher
sampler loop that records one sample per connected instance every
`telemetry.sample_seconds` (default 30s) by reading the existing sidecar over
the managed SSH connection. This is additive and off the launch path: no
guard, launch, or termination logic changed. Nothing new listens on the
instance (still sidecar-on-loopback only).

**Alternatives considered:** (1) gate the hint on average utilization —
rejected, it OOMs memory-bound jobs. (2) Mean instead of median — rejected,
skewed by stuck runs. (3) A single confidence-free number — rejected, it
would present a 1-run guess and a 20-run median as equally trustworthy. (4)
Auto-selecting the smaller GPU — rejected outright per the brief: recommend,
never override.

## 2026-07-12 — Queue-then-launch (auto-manage): v1 is sequential, sharing deferred

**Context (Prompt B):** let a user queue a job with NO instance running and
have Manifold own the whole lifecycle: wait for a slot, launch, run, sync
outputs, terminate. The zero-waste headline: a GPU exists only while there is
work for it.

**Decided:** ship v1 as a **sequential per-job lifecycle**, and defer
instance *sharing* (reusing one box across several compatible jobs) to a
follow-up. Each auto-managed job drives its own instance through:

    waiting -> launching -> ready -> running -> syncing -> terminating -> done

At most one auto-managed job holds the single-instance slot at a time; the
next waits its turn. A new dispatcher loop (`_auto_manage_loop`) advances one
job per tick and is **stateless across ticks** (it reads the job's lifecycle
from SQLite), so a backend restart resumes wherever the job left off.

**No guard is duplicated or bypassed — the queued path calls the SAME
functions the dashboard does.** Concretely:
- launch = `orchestrator.request_launch(...)` (budget, concurrency,
  region-filesystem match, capacity retry all apply, unchanged);
- dispatch = the existing `_task_loop` / `_run_task` (the job binds to its own
  instance, see below);
- sync = `orchestrator.sync_ephemeral(...)`;
- terminate = `orchestrator.terminate(..., force=False)` (the Phase 3 safety
  hook still runs).
The lifecycle loop is glue that sequences these; it contains no guard logic.

**Wait-vs-fail without re-deriving the guards.** `LaunchRejected` now carries
a `reason_code`. On a rejected launch the lifecycle classifies:
- `concurrency` (the single slot is busy, e.g. a manual instance is up) ->
  stay in `waiting`, retry next tick. Never fails the job.
- `budget` / `validation` / `mode` -> can never be admitted -> fail the job
  with the guard's own message (Gate B: an over-budget job is rejected with a
  clear reason and NO instance is ever created).
The classification reads only which check refused; it does not recompute the
budget or concurrency math (single source of truth stays in the orchestrator).

**Dispatch binding.** The dispatcher previously ran any queued task on the
first connected instance. That is now `_pick_dispatchable`, which binds:
- an auto-managed job runs ONLY on the instance its own lifecycle launched,
  and only once that instance is `ready` (connected);
- a manual job runs on any connected instance NOT owned by an auto-managed
  lifecycle.
So a manual job never lands on a box about to be torn down, and an
auto-managed job never hijacks a manually launched box. Scanning (not just
the oldest task) stops a waiting job of one kind from head-of-line-blocking a
ready job of the other.

**Every state transition is audited** with the job id and (once it exists) the
instance id: `auto_manage_launching/ready/running/syncing/terminating/done`,
plus `auto_manage_waiting`, `auto_manage_failed`, `auto_manage_cancelled`,
`auto_manage_terminate_blocked`.

**Alternatives:** concurrent tasks per instance (already rejected,
DECISIONS.md 2026-07-11 "One task at a time"); a separate dispatch path for
auto jobs (would duplicate the well-tested `_run_task`); failing a job the
moment a slot is busy (wrong: the slot frees, so waiting is correct).

**Why sequential first:** under `max_concurrent_instances = 1` the two
existing invariants (one instance, one task at a time) already serialize
everything. Sequential per-job lifecycle drops onto that cleanly and is
provably safe. Sharing needs a compatibility + drain + ownership model and a
few semantic calls (below), so it was split out deliberately (James approved
this split).

## 2026-07-12 — Auto-manage vs idle-termination and keep-alive: the lifecycle owns teardown

**Decided:** an instance an in-flight auto-managed job owns is **exempt from
the idle loop and the manual keep-alive switch**. `_check_idle` skips every
instance in `db.auto_managed_instance_ids()` (jobs whose lifecycle is
launching/ready/running/syncing/terminating), keep-alive or not.

**Why:** the auto-manage lifecycle already owns teardown (sync -> terminate).
If the idle loop also tried to terminate the box, the two would race during
the windows where no task is "running" (between `ready` and dispatch, and
during `syncing`/`terminating`). Skipping owned instances makes the lifecycle
the single terminator. The idle loop remains the **backstop**: the moment a
job reaches a terminal lifecycle it drops out of the owned set, so a box that
somehow outlives its lifecycle still gets reaped by idle. Keep-alive stays a
manual-instance concept; an ephemeral auto-managed box is not something you
keep alive.

**Termination blocked = surface, never force (differs from the idle flow).**
The idle loop, being fully unattended, does sync-then-force. Auto-manage does
NOT: per the brief, after the intended sync it calls `terminate(force=False)`,
and if the safety hook still finds unpersisted files it **surfaces the block
and leaves the box running for review** (audited as
`auto_manage_terminate_blocked`), exactly like the manual flow. The lifecycle
loop keeps retrying `force=False`, so the instant the user syncs/clears the
files (or terminates manually) the job completes on its own. A false
force-terminate here would be an unattended data-loss path, which is exactly
what the hook exists to prevent.

## 2026-07-12 — Recorded answers for the instance-SHARING follow-up (pending confirmation)

The sharing optimization (reuse one box across compatible auto-managed jobs,
terminate after the last) was deferred from v1. James asked to record the
answers to the three semantic questions here so the follow-up has a spec.
These are my recommended defaults, consistent with this codebase's
conservative posture; confirm or amend before building sharing.

- **(a) What is "compatible"?** Byte-identical: same instance_type AND region
  AND filesystem. It is the only definition that is provably safe without a
  GPU-substitutability matrix (is an A100 an acceptable stand-in for an A10
  job? memory, price, and availability all differ). Looser matching can come
  later; exact-match is the safe first step.
- **(b) May auto-manage reuse or tear down a MANUALLY launched instance?**
  No. An auto-managed job only ever reuses or terminates instances its own
  lifecycle launched (ownership tracked on the launch row). Tearing down a
  human's box would be surprising and destructive; silently commandeering one
  blurs ownership. v1 already behaves this way (an auto job waits for a slot
  rather than touching a manual box).
- **(c) A compatible job arrives while the box is DRAINING toward teardown —
  reclaim it?** Yes, but only in the narrow window before `terminate()` is
  actually in flight: if a compatible job appears while the instance is still
  up and teardown has not been called, cancel the teardown and reclaim the box
  (that is the whole efficiency win). Once `terminate()` has been invoked, let
  it complete and the new job launches fresh, rather than racing an in-flight
  termination.

Implementing sharing on these answers still requires: a compatibility match in
the dispatcher, an ownership flag + a drain/reference-count so teardown fires
only after the LAST compatible job, and idle-loop reconciliation for the
shared case. That is the "more than trivial work" that kept it out of v1.

## 2026-07-12 — Template audit: verify every image against its registry, findings per template

**Context (Phase 25):** whisper-batch failed live — `docker pull
ghcr.io/speaches-ai/faster-whisper-server:latest-cuda` returned "denied"
(exit 125), meaning the GPU booted and billed just to discover the image was
gone. vllm-serve had also failed live (exit -1 AFTER a successful pull).
James asked for a full audit of all 8 templates and a rewrite of anything
unverifiable.

**Method:** no docker daemon was available locally, so every image was
checked against its registry's OCI/Docker v2 HTTP API (manifest GET with
anonymous token exchange) — which is the stronger check anyway, because it
verifies exactly what an instance's anonymous `docker pull` sees. For
vllm-serve, the image's config blob was fetched to read its REAL entrypoint
rather than guessing from docs.

**Findings, per template (audited 2026-07-12):**
- axolotl-finetune / `axolotlai/axolotl:main-latest` — EXISTS, kept.
- gpu-smoke / `nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04` — EXISTS, kept.
- llm-synthesize / `python:3.11-slim` — EXISTS; but the template had the
  env-script expansion bug (next entry): it was a SILENT NO-OP.
- script-run / `python:3.11-slim` — EXISTS; same silent no-op bug.
- sdxl-generate / `huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu:latest` — EXISTS;
  script survived but multi-word prompts were split apart (same entry).
- tao-train / `nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:5.5.0-tf2.11.0` — MISSING
  (nvcr 404). The live tag list shows the 5.5.0 TF2 image is `5.5.0-tf2`;
  the `-tf2.11.0` naming stopped at 5.0.0. Fixed to `5.5.0-tf2` (verified).
- vllm-serve / `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` — image EXISTS; the command was
  wrong. The image config's entrypoint is `["vllm", "serve"]`, and
  `vllm serve` takes the model as a POSITIONAL argument. The template passed
  `--model <id>`, which the CLI rejects — hence exit -1 after a good pull.
  Fixed: model is now positional; `--max-model-len/--port` stay as flags.
- whisper-batch / `ghcr.io/speaches-ai/faster-whisper-server:latest-cuda` —
  NOT ANONYMOUSLY PULLABLE (ghcr denied), matching the live failure, and its
  `python -m scripts.batch_transcribe` entrypoint was never verifiable.
  REWRITTEN (next-but-one entry).

**Rule going forward:** never reference an image (or an image's internal
script) that has not been verified against its registry. The backend now
enforces the image half automatically (preflight entry below).

## 2026-07-12 — Env-script templates: the host shell was eating $PYCODE/$RUNNER

**Found during the audit (worse than the image bugs):** three templates ship
their program in an env var and run it via the container shell. The rendered
`docker run ... -e 'PYCODE=...' image python -c "$PYCODE" args` is executed
by the INSTANCE's shell — where PYCODE is not set. The double-quoted
`"$PYCODE"` was expanded to empty ON THE HOST, so:
- llm-synthesize ran `python -c '' ...` — a SILENT NO-OP that exits 0 and
  reports "succeeded" while synthesizing nothing;
- script-run ran `bash -c '' ...` — same silent no-op;
- sdxl-generate kept its script (it was inside single quotes) but had
  `{{prompt}}` INSIDE those quotes, so a multi-word prompt was word-split
  into separate argv entries (prompt "a red cat" generated images of "a").

**Fix — one pattern for all env-script templates:**
    command: bash -c '<script using $VAR and "$@">' argv0 {{param}} {{param}}
The single quotes stop the host shell from touching `$VAR` (the container
shell expands it, where the env IS set); parameters stay at the top level
where the dispatcher's shlex-quoting is correct, and reach the script as
intact positional args via `"$@"`. script-run uses `eval "$RUNNER"` inside
the quotes (eval sees the same positional params).

**Enforcement:** tests/test_template_quoting.py simulates the instance shell
with a fake `docker` that records its argv, then asserts (a) the `-e VAR=`
body is present, (b) the container command still contains the LITERAL $VAR
(host did not expand it), and (c) a multi-word parameter arrives as ONE
argument. Any regression to the unquoted form fails CI.

**Why the old form looked fine:** the previous script-run comment claimed
putting params inside `bash -c '...'` "collides the quotes" — true — but the
"fix" moved the VAR reference outside the single quotes, which is exactly
what handed it to the host shell. The empirical fake-docker simulation is
what caught it; eyeballing quoting did not.

## 2026-07-12 — whisper-batch rewritten: verified base + a transcriber Manifold owns

**Decided:** whisper-batch now runs on
`pytorch/pytorch:2.4.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime` (manifest verified; cuDNN 9
is what CTranslate2, faster-whisper's backend, needs on CUDA 12), does
`pip install faster-whisper` at container start (~30s), and runs a ~65-line
transcriber script that LIVES IN THE TEMPLATE (PYCODE env), not inside a
third-party image. Same contract as before: reads /data/input, writes
<name>.srt + <name>.json to /data/output (persistent transcripts/), HF cache
on persistent storage, per-file failures logged but never fatal, exits
nonzero if nothing transcribed.

**Alternatives:** another prebuilt whisper image (same third-party risk that
just burned us — the speaches image vanished/went private under ghcr);
building and hosting our own image (infrastructure Manifold does not have);
WhisperX (heavier deps for no requirement).

**Why:** the base image is an official, verifiable artifact; the script is
in-repo where it can be reviewed, tested (its syntax is ast-checked in CI
via the quoting test loading the template) and fixed without waiting on
anyone's registry. The ~30s pip install per run is the explicit price of
owning the moving part; pin a custom image later if whisper becomes hot.

## 2026-07-12 — Image preflight: never boot a GPU to discover a missing image

**Decided:** before an auto-managed job launches (and before ANY job is
dispatched), the backend verifies the template's image manifest exists in
its registry (`app/image_checker.py`, Registry v2 API with anonymous token
exchange — exactly what the instance's anonymous `docker pull` does). A
definitively-missing image (404, or 403/denied where registries hide
missing-vs-private) fails the job immediately as
"image not found: <image>" with ZERO launches; the manual path fails it
before any docker command reaches the instance, audited as
`task_image_missing`.

**Fail-open on anything undetermined** (network blip, a registry that will
not answer anonymous existence queries): the job proceeds and, worst case,
dies at docker pull on the instance — exactly the pre-preflight behavior, no
worse. A flaky checker must never become a wall in front of every launch.
Known limit: ghcr.io returns the same opaque denial for missing and private
repos AND refuses anonymous token exchange for nonexistent ones, so ghcr
images are usually "undetermined" (fail-open). docker.io and nvcr.io — every
image the templates use today — give definitive answers. Results are cached
5 minutes per image.

**Wiring:** mock mode injects MockImageChecker (offline, approves everything,
overridable per test); production wiring gets RealImageChecker; a test
harness that injects a lambda_client without a checker gets preflight OFF so
the suite can never touch the network by accident.

**Also fixed while wiring:** a dispatch-time failure (missing image, bad
parameters) finishes an auto-managed job's task WITHOUT it ever reaching
'running'. The lifecycle previously idled at 'ready' waiting for dispatch —
leaving the launched box up forever, and the idle loop deliberately skips
auto-owned instances. 'ready' now runs the same settled-check as 'running',
so the lifecycle still syncs and terminates the box (test:
test_auto_job_torn_down_after_dispatch_time_failure).

## 2026-07-12 — Chat tools: the served model gets guarded arms

**Context:** the in-dashboard chat relayed text only, so the model (which is
stateless text-in/text-out) could not see the filesystem or start work —
James expected "one synergetic system where the instance runs the model and
the model can talk to the instance and filebase".

**Decided:** the chat endpoint gains a tools mode (`tools: true`, the panel's
default). The backend runs the loop, Autopilot-style: the model replies with
one JSON action, the backend executes it through EXISTING guarded paths and
feeds the observation back; plain text ends the loop as the final answer.
Tool surface (chat_tools.py): list_files / read_file (sidecar + managed SSH,
confined to the file-navigator roots, 16 KB head-read cap), list_templates /
run_job (the same coerce + queue path as everyone else), get_job_status /
get_job_logs. No shell, no HTTP, no launch/terminate from chat — that stays
Autopilot's job with its run ledger and step caps. Every tool call is
audited (actor "chat"). Max 8 tool calls per user message.

**Trade-off:** tools mode answers arrive turn-at-once (the backend must see
the full reply to detect a tool call); the Tools toggle off restores pure
token streaming. UI also gained: tool-call progress lines, a vertically
resizable conversation area (CSS resize-y), and image attach via drag/drop
or button — sent as OpenAI image_url content parts, which only vision models
(e.g. Qwen2.5-VL) can read; the panel says so next to pending images.

## 2026-07-12 — Model presets refreshed (July 2026) + tensor_parallel for cluster serves

**Decided:** replaced the Qwen2.5-era preset catalog with current popular
open-weight models, every repo id verified against the HF API on 2026-07-12
(exists, gated=False, so vllm-openai pulls with no token): Qwen3-4B/8B/14B,
openai/gpt-oss-20b/120b, Qwen3.6-27B (+FP8), Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8,
tencent/Hy3-FP8, zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8. Tiers map to Lambda's actual GPUs:
A10 24GB, A100 40GB, H100 80GB, 8x H100 (640GB), 8x B200 (1.4TB).

**Sizing corrections vs the request:** Qwen3.6 does fit a single H100
(27B bf16) and even an A100 40GB (27B-FP8) — as asked. But Hy3 is a 295B
MoE: it does NOT fit one H100; the FP8 checkpoint (~300GB) needs the 8x H100
cluster. GLM-5.2 is 744B (~750GB FP8): not one B200, the 8x B200 cluster.
Presets say so in their tier/notes rather than offering a serve that OOMs.

**Enabler:** vllm-serve gained a `tensor_parallel` parameter (default 1 —
existing single-GPU serves unchanged) appended as --tensor-parallel-size;
cluster presets carry {"tensor_parallel": 8} and the Jobs page seeds a
preset's extra parameters into the form alongside the model id.

## 2026-07-12 — Night hardening pass: dark theme as tokens, distillation loop closed, SGLang added

**Dark theme via palette remap, one file.** The dashboard was authored light
and users saw it through the browser's forced dark mode (muddy, accidental).
Now globals.css IS the theme: Tailwind v4 @theme re-points the palette the
components already use, so class names keep their ROLE (white = card
surface, zinc-50 = canvas, zinc-900 = primary text / inverted buttons,
zinc-950 = terminal blocks; accent -50/-100/-200 tints become dark glass,
-700/-800/-900 text lightened). Zero component sweep; the ~10 places where
the role genuinely flips (light text on log blocks, white text on saturated
buttons, decorative separators) were hand-fixed. Fonts: Space Grotesk (UI) +
JetBrains Mono (terminal surfaces, section headers, wordmark) via next/font.
One brand accent (teal phosphor) used only for selection, focus, the canvas
glow, and the wordmark cursor. Alternatives: hand-editing every component
(hundreds of class changes, drift forever) or CSS filter inversion (breaks
images and shadows). The remap centralizes taste per the design-tokens rule.

**Distillation loop closed (teacher -> data -> student).** llm-synthesize
gained output_format=alpaca ({"instruction","input","output"} rows) and
axolotl-finetune now mounts synthesized/ read-only at /data/synthesized, so
the teacher's output trains the student with zero file shuffling. The whole
walk (serve teacher, synthesize, LoRA fine-tune, use the adapter) is
docs/distill-your-own-model.md, with honest costs and caveats (gated
students need an HF token Manifold does not pass yet).

**sglang-serve template.** SGLang is the other major OpenAI-compatible
serving engine (LMSYS); its RadixAttention reuses shared prompt prefixes
automatically, making it faster than vLLM for agent/RAG workloads that
resend long system prompts (vLLM stays the default for one-off prompts and
has the broader hardware support). Because both expose the same API, the
template is a sibling of vllm-serve: same loopback-only publish, same HF
cache mount, same ports block - so chat, the /v1 proxy, Autopilot, and
llm-synthesize work against it unchanged (find_serving_task keys on
ports + model_id, both present). Image + entrypoint verified against the
registry (nvidia passthrough entrypoint; full launch command supplied).

## 2026-07-12 — Desktop packaging: Tauri shell around ONE frozen process

**Context:** turn localhost Manifold into a downloadable .dmg/.msi. James
chose Tauri v2 over pywebview (no installer/updater story) and Electron
(~200MB Chromium for no gain).

**Shape (two layers, one process of substance):**
- The dashboard already prerendered every route statically, so
  `output: "export"` makes it plain files that FastAPI serves at `/`
  (mounted LAST; API routes win). No Node at runtime.
- PyInstaller freezes backend + templates/ + sidecar + config default + the
  exported UI into one ~39MB binary (`backend/desktop.py` entrypoint,
  loopback-only). This binary alone IS the product; the shell is chrome.
- Tauri spawns it as a sidecar, shows a themed splash until the port
  answers, navigates the native window to it, and kills it on exit. If the
  port already serves (dev backend running), it reuses instead of spawning
  a duplicate.

**Path split that makes packaging safe** (config.py): RESOURCE_ROOT
(read-only bundle assets; sys._MEIPASS when frozen) vs DATA_ROOT (mutable
state: .env, config.yaml, manifold.db, host_keys.json) which moves to
~/Library/Application Support/Manifold (mac) / %APPDATA%\Manifold (win).
First run scaffolds the dir and seeds config.yaml from the bundled default.
Development behavior is byte-identical (both roots = repo root), which is
why the whole suite passes untouched.

**Frontend URL detection** (`dashboard/lib/backend.ts`): one source of
truth. Same-origin when served by the backend, localhost:8000 under the
:3000 dev server, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL overrides. Replaced four scattered
copies of the localhost fallback (api.ts, ChatPanel, TerminalPanel,
TelemetryChart) - the desktop app breaks without this, since its origin is
127.0.0.1:8000 itself.

**Receipts:** frozen binary booted standalone: every dashboard route 200,
all 9 templates loaded from the bundle, fresh DATA_ROOT scaffolded with
seeded config + empty db. CI (.github/workflows/desktop.yml) builds dmg
(macos-14) + msi (windows-2022) on v* tags. Local dmg note: Tauri's
bundle_dmg.sh drives Finder via AppleScript and fails headless; plain
`hdiutil create` produces the same artifact without the styled window.

**Orphan bug found at the gate:** quitting the app killed only PyInstaller's
bootloader; the real server survived and held :8000 forever. Fix: the shell
sets MANIFOLD_PARENT_WATCHDOG=1 and the backend self-terminates on stdin
EOF (its stdin is a pipe from the shell, so EOF = the shell died, however
it died). Opt-in via env so terminal runs never self-terminate. Retested:
launch -> serve -> quit -> zero processes, port released.

**Honest limits:** bundles are UNSIGNED until Apple Developer ($99/yr) /
Authenticode accounts exist - Gatekeeper/SmartScreen will warn; the
workflow has the hook points. No auto-updater until signing lands (unsigned
updates are unsafe). Windows build is CI-defined but untested on real
hardware. MCP stays a dev-checkout feature for now.

## 2026-07-12 — Sharing the desktop app: GitHub Releases on a version tag, not a committed binary

**Decided:** the `.dmg`/`.msi` are shared via a GitHub Release (a new
`release` job in `.github/workflows/desktop.yml`, gated on `refs/tags/v*`
and running after both platform builds), not by committing them into the
repo. Pushing a tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) makes CI
attach both installers to one Release, giving a stable public URL
(`/releases/latest`) that needs no GitHub login - unlike the existing
`upload-artifact` step, which is login-gated and expires in 90 days.

**Why not commit the binaries:** git tracks line diffs; a 40MB+ binary has
none, so every commit that touches it (and every future clone of the repo)
carries the full weight forever, with no way to shrink history later
short of a rewrite. Releases are the purpose-built mechanism - versioned,
downloadable, outside the tree that `git clone` pulls by default.

**Repo visibility check (2026-07-12):** confirmed `Somnora/Manifold-` is
already public, and confirmed no secret ever entered git history — `.env`,
`manifold.db`, `host_keys.json` are gitignored and were never tracked.
Sharing the repo link was already safe before this change.

## 2026-07-13 — Per-instance parallel dispatch (supersedes "one task at a time")

**Found at James's mock test pass.** Three compounding problems: (1) the
dispatcher awaited each job INLINE and refused to dispatch while anything
was running — so a server job (vllm-serve streams for its lifetime) froze
every other job forever, contradicting the documented serve+synthesize
pipeline; (2) with several GPUs there was no way to say which box a job
should run on; (3) the mock SSH process exited instantly for server jobs, so
vllm-serve went 'succeeded' in a second and chat/autopilot had no brain to
find — masking bug (1) in every demo and test.

**Decided:**
- Dispatch spawns each job as its own asyncio task (`_dispatching` map
  guards the queued->running gap and lets stop() cancel). Instances run
  their work independently.
- Per-instance concurrency rule: one BATCH task at a time (GPU contention),
  one SERVER at a time (its port), but server+batch coexist — that is the
  sanctioned pipeline. The 2026-07-11 "one task at a time" entry is
  superseded; its rationale (serialized batch work per GPU) survives as the
  per-instance batch rule.
- Manual jobs accept `target_instance_id` (Jobs page "Run on" picker);
  untargeted jobs take the first free non-auto-owned instance. Auto-managed
  jobs still bind only to their own launched box.
- Idle: a running task pins ITS OWN instance only — a job on box A no
  longer keeps an idle box B billing (previously any running task blocked
  ALL idle termination). Auto-owned instances stay lifecycle-governed.
- Mock fidelity: mock server processes (commands publishing ports) stay
  RUNNING until the connection closes (`MockSSHConnection.close()` now EOFs
  open streams so nothing hangs); and mock mode always forces its own
  registered ssh key — a real key name in config.yaml made every
  auto-manage launch fail in the packaged demo.

**Multi-GPU how-to:** raise `guardrails.max_concurrent_instances` (and mind
`max_hourly_spend_usd`) in config.yaml; the guard stays deliberate.

**Known mock-demo quirk (spec-correct):** the demo sidecar reports two
canned unpersisted files, so an auto-manage teardown parks at 'terminating'
with the reason on the job card — the safety hook doing exactly what
Prompt B specified (never force). Resolve from the instance card (sync /
terminate) and the job completes.

## 2026-07-13 — The local hub: external brains, approval gates, local terminal

**Context:** James's north star - "one synergetic system": local models,
frontier APIs, and GPU-served models all first-class drivers of Manifold,
plus a terminal on the local machine, plus approval-gated agent spending.

**Brains registry (brains.py).** One abstraction, three kinds:
`instance:` (served on a Manifold GPU, the original), `local:` (Ollama /
LM Studio on this machine, auto-detected by probing /v1/models on their
standard loopback ports), `api:` (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini via their
OpenAI-compatible endpoints; offered ONLY when the key env var is set, so
there is never a selectable-but-broken option). All three expose the same
chat interface (ExternalBrainClient duck-types ModelClient), so the agent
loop is brain-agnostic: Autopilot.start_run takes a client factory, and
the run's brain ref is stored in the existing brain_instance_id column
(strings like "local:ollama/llama3.1" - no schema migration).
**The safety model is deliberately unchanged by the brain:** same action
allowlist, same guards, same caps, same audit - a frontier model gets no
more power than a 4B local one.

**Approval gates.** Runs started with require_approval pause launch_gpu /
run_job / terminate_instance as a `pending` row in a new approvals table;
the agent loop polls until a human decision. Deny returns "DENIED by the
user" AS DATA (the model adapts - test-proven, and nothing executes);
approve falls through to the normal guarded execution; a timeout
(autopilot.approval_timeout_seconds, 600s) auto-denies so an unattended
run never spends. decide_approval uses a status='pending' WHERE guard, so
a double-click or race decides exactly once. Gated set choice: the three
actions that spend money or destroy state; reads stay free because an
approval prompt per get_job_status would make the feature unusable.

**Local terminal.** WS /local/terminal forks a login shell in a pty and
speaks the exact wire protocol of the instance terminal (one generalized
TerminalPanel drives both). Threat model: the backend is loopback-only,
but browsers allow cross-origin WebSockets that CORS middleware does NOT
cover - so the endpoint enforces a strict Origin allowlist (localhost /
127.0.0.1) before accepting, plus a config kill switch
(hub.local_terminal). POSIX-only for now; Windows says so instead of
half-working. Audited on open. Alternatives: no local terminal (but the
hub's whole point is one pane of glass), an allow-any-origin socket
(would let any website you visit run shell commands - rejected).

**Hub page.** The meeting point: local terminal, live brains list with
kind badges, pending approvals. Autopilot's picker now reads the same
/brains registry instead of probing instances itself.

## 2026-07-13 — Subscription brains via CLI delegation, not spoofed OAuth

**Asked:** OAuth login for frontier models instead of API keys.

**Decided:** `cli:` brains. The user logs into the provider's own CLI once
(claude / codex / gemini - each ships its own official OAuth flow), and
Manifold invokes that CLI as a subprocess per turn (CliBrainClient: argv
list, no shell, cwd = an empty scratch dir so an agentic CLI has nothing
to poke at, hard timeout, stderr surfaced with an "is it logged in?"
hint). Detection = executable on PATH; the registry offers what exists.
Invocations verified against the installed CLIs' actual flags: claude
`-p --output-format json` (.result), codex `exec --skip-git-repo-check
-s read-only --output-last-message <tmp>`, gemini `-p -o text`.

**Why not real OAuth:** the providers' subscription OAuth client ids
belong to their own apps; a third-party impersonating Claude Code's or
Codex's client id violates provider ToS and risks the user's ACCOUNT.
The sanctioned third-party programs (Anthropic's and OpenAI's "sign in
with your subscription") are preview/waitlist and require registering the
app for its own client id - noted as the future replacement. CLI
delegation gives the same UX today (log in once with the provider's own
flow, no API key, subscription billing) with zero ToS exposure and zero
token handling in Manifold.

**Unchanged:** the brain safety model. A CLI brain gets the same action
allowlist, guards, caps, approval gates, and audit as every other brain.

## 2026-07-13 — Unattended safety: per-action approvals, notifications, data rescue

Three asks, one theme: make a run that nobody is watching SAFE. Autopilot
already had guards; what it lacked was a way to be away from the keyboard
without either losing money or losing data.

### Approvals are now per-action, and the default gates launches only

**Decided:** `ApprovalPrefs{launch_gpu: true, run_job: false,
terminate_instance: false}` (preferences.py), overridable per run via
`approve_actions` on POST /autopilot/runs. The old boolean
`require_approval` still works (true = gate everything) and old runs still
read back correctly (`agent_runs.approval_policy` is additive; the boolean
column is kept as the derived "is anything gated" flag).

**Why launch-only, and why this is not timidity:** an approval nobody
answers AUTO-DENIES after `autopilot.approval_timeout_seconds`. So gating an
action means "if I am away from my desk, this action does not happen":

| gated action | what a no-answer denial costs |
|---|---|
| `launch_gpu` | nothing. No GPU starts, $0 spent. |
| `terminate_instance` | **the GPU keeps billing** while the approval rots. |
| `run_job` | a GPU you are already paying for sits idle. |

Gating a shutdown therefore burns money exactly when you are away — which is
when autopilot runs. It is off by default, the UI warns when you switch it
on, and `test_default_policy_does_not_gate_termination` exists so nobody
"helpfully" flips it later. The launch is the decision that needs a human;
the shutdown is the one that must not wait for one.

**Alternative rejected:** making an expired approval AUTO-APPROVE for
terminate (so the wallet is safe either way). Rejected: an approval gate
whose failure mode is "does it anyway" is not a gate. Better to not gate the
action than to pretend to.

### Notifications: a pause nobody hears about is a stall, not a safeguard

**Decided:** a `notifications` table + `NotificationCenter`, with five
independently-toggled kinds (approval_requested, job_succeeded, job_failed,
run_finished, data_transferred). Two channels: an in-app bell (always
recorded, so history survives) and a real OS notification (macOS
`osascript`, Linux `notify-send`) so it reaches you in another app — which
is the entire point. The OS sender is INJECTED (`notification_sender`), so
tests record instead of spraying the developer's Notification Center, and
mock mode is silent.

Every job completion in the dispatcher was funnelled through one
`_finish_task`, so no completion path — bad parameters, missing image, lost
SSH, container exit, auto-manage failure — can finish silently. That funnel
is the feature; the notification is just what hangs off it.

**Preferences live in SQLite, not config.yaml.** config.yaml is a file a
human edits, with comments and ordering; a UI that rewrote it would eat
both. So config.yaml supplies the DEFAULTS and the `preferences` table holds
what the user changed in Settings. `preferences_from_dict` ignores unknown
keys and clamps illegal enums, so neither a hand-edited YAML nor a hostile
PUT can produce an unstartable app.

### Termination now RESCUES data instead of refusing

**Changed a Phase 3 contract deliberately.** The safety hook used to REFUSE
to terminate while valuable files sat on the instance's ephemeral disk. That
is the right answer with a human watching and the wrong one at 3am: an
unattended run hits the 409, the GPU keeps billing, and nobody sees it. Each
caller had also reimplemented its own sync-then-force dance (the idle loop
did; the MCP agent had to be taught to).

`Orchestrator.terminate(force=False)` now: asks the sidecar what is on the
scratch disk → RESCUES it per the data-safety policy → and refuses only if
something could not be saved. `TerminationBlocked.files` therefore changed
meaning, from "files that exist" to "files still at risk", and it now carries
the report of what WAS saved. `force=true` is unchanged: the explicit burn-it.

The user's proposed menu was four options ("all files to local", "all to
filebase", "synthesized only to local", "synthesized only to filebase").
That is a cross-product of two independent questions, so it is modelled as
two:

- **WHERE**: `to_filesystem` (rsync to the Lambda volume — datacenter-local,
  so fast, free, and it covers the whole scratch dir at once) and/or
  `to_local` (SFTP down the managed connection to this machine, which costs
  real transfer time while the GPU bills, so it is off by default and
  budgeted by `max_local_gib`, smallest-file-first).
- **WHAT**: `scope: all | outputs` (outputs = files under `outputs/`, the
  deliverable convention — pull the results, leave the 40 GB checkpoint).

And the question the menu missed, which is the one that actually matters:
**what if a file cannot be saved?** `if_unsaveable: block | terminate`.
Default `block`: keep the instance alive with the data intact and ping the
user. Data loss is permanent; a billing hour is not. `terminate` is
available for people who mean it, and is recorded in the audit log
(`terminate_data_lost`) and the notification — never silent.

**Honest reporting is a requirement, not a nicety.** A rescue that quietly
drops files is worse than no rescue, because it lies. Anything skipped
(scope, budget, transfer failure) is reported with its reason and counted as
unsaved, which is what the block keys on. Downloads go to a `.part` file and
are renamed on completion, so an interrupted rescue cannot leave a truncated
file that looks saved. Paths come FROM the instance, so both the remote and
local sides are normalized and confined (`data_safety.remote_path` /
`local_path`) — a hostile sidecar cannot traverse out of the scratch root or
out of the rescue directory.

**The decisions are pure.** `data_safety.py` does no I/O: scope selection,
transfer budgeting, and path confinement are testable without an instance, an
SSH server, or a byte of network. The transport lives in the orchestrator,
which owns the connections.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 38: nav consolidation + ambient burn rate

**Problem:** 8 top-level pages for this scope, with two overlapping pairs.
Hub and Autopilot both showed brains and both rendered ApprovalsPanel; Agent
Activity and History were both "what happened" pages (audit trail vs cost
ledger). And the hourly burn — the single most important number in the
product — was visible on exactly one page.

**Decided (frontend only, zero backend changes):**

- **Hub merged into Autopilot.** Brains and approvals live where runs start.
  The Hub's third feature, the local terminal, is a TOOL, not a PLACE: it
  became a bottom drawer toggled by the `>_` header button, available on
  every page. Once opened it stays MOUNTED and is only hidden with CSS, so
  closing the drawer does not kill the shell — navigate anywhere, reopen,
  and the session (history, cwd, running command) is where you left it.
- **Agent Activity merged into History as the "Activity" page** with
  Spend / Audit tabs. The audit table moved verbatim into
  components/AuditLog.tsx; deep link `/history?tab=audit`.
- **Old URLs keep working**: /hub and /agents are client redirect stubs
  (static export cannot do server redirects), so desktop-app bookmarks and
  doc links don't break.
- **BurnChip in the header** next to the bell on every page: sum of running
  instances' hourly rates, amber + pulsing when > $0, click-through to
  Instances where the terminate buttons are. Renders nothing while the
  backend is unreachable — an unknown must not display as a reassuring $0.

Nav went 8 -> 6: Instances · Jobs · Storage | Autopilot | Activity ·
Settings. Deliberately NOT touched: the Jobs page's density is earned (one
coherent workflow); Storage's region limitation is a separate problem.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 39: power without training wheels

Four asks from live testing, one theme: advanced users (and their agents)
should never hit a wall that exists only for ceremony.

**Guardrail NUMBERS moved to Settings; the guards did not move.** The
concurrency/budget guards stay in orchestrator.request_launch (hard rule),
but the limits they enforce now read through the preference store:
Settings -> Spending guardrails, 0/blank = config.yaml default. Raising the
instance limit no longer needs a YAML edit + restart. Guard rejection
messages point at Settings instead of config.yaml.

**Filesystem is optional at launch.** filesystem="" launches a scratch-only
instance in ANY region with capacity - previously a region without one of
your filesystems was unlaunchable. Consequences fall out of existing
machinery, deliberately: jobs mounting {persistent} fail with a clear
reason; sync has nowhere to go, so the rescue reports sync_error and the
data-safety policy decides (default: block termination while unsaved files
exist; to_local download is the net). The launch form says all of this in
amber BEFORE the click. No new code path touches the guards.

**Custom job templates - the "skills" model.** User/agent-authored YAML in
custom-templates/ under the data dir, loaded alongside the bundled set into
ONE shared dict that reloads in place (dispatcher/autopilot/brains all see
new templates with no restart). Validated by the SAME parser and mount jail
as bundled templates: a custom template is a recipe, not an escape hatch
(test: a template mounting /etc is rejected with 422). User templates win
name collisions; deleting one restores the bundled original. Files, not DB
rows - portable, committable, backupable. Editor on the Jobs page; agents
get MCP save_template/delete_template. The design goal is agent-as-
scaffolding: prove a workflow with the agent once, save it, rerun it
forever as a form - no tokens, no re-explaining.

**run_command: SSH parity, audited.** The honest answer to "do agents get
the same tools as SSH?" used to be "no". Now the difference is visibility,
not capability: POST /instances/{id}/run (MCP run_command) runs one shell
command over the managed connection, hard-timeout (<=600s), output capped,
audited with exit code, idle-clock touched. Guards still bind everything.
The instruction to give agents stays: use the manifold tools, not ssh -
same power, but on the record.

Docs: codex + gemini MCP registration blocks and the parity section in
mcp-setup.md; new custom-templates.md authoring guide.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 39 additions from the live test pass

**The dock generalized to all instance panels.** Chat, recent Files, and the
file Browser open in the dock (tabs or split, bottom or right) instead of
unrolling inside the instance card - one surface for everything
instance-scoped, and it survives page navigation. Multiple shells: a "+"
on any terminal tab duplicates it (fresh pty, numbered label), and a
"+ >_" button adds more Local Machine tabs. Local tab renamed
"Local Machine".

**Instance rename is a local overlay.** Lambda fixes an instance's name at
launch; instance_names in SQLite overlays it everywhere Manifold shows
names. Empty restores Lambda's. No Lambda API call involved.

**Unlimited autopilot steps: max_steps=0.** The unlimited toggle stores 0
and the loop switches to itertools.count - the run ends only via
done/cancel/failure. Deliberately NOT a bigger cap: the money is already
bounded by guards + approval gates + the wait cap + consecutive-failure
kill; the step cap only bounded TURNS, and for long unattended goals that
was the artificial wall. Finite runs keep the 50-step hard cap.

**Autopilot can author templates mid-run (save_template action).** Same
validated path as the Jobs page and MCP (one save_custom_template_text
helper in the app factory feeds all three), so the mount jail binds the
agent identically. What a run saves persists for the user - agent as
scaffolding, again.

**Template editor contrast bug:** the dark theme remaps the zinc scale, so
text-zinc-100 on bg-zinc-950 was ink-on-ink. Terminal-style editors now use
the terminal's own literal hex palette, not remapped tokens.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 40: field hardening for slow real boots

From a field report by an agent orchestrator that ran the sprite-to-3D
workflow on real GPUs. Five backend fixes, all against the same failure:
large SXM4 instances take much longer to boot than the code assumed.

**Boot timeout 900s -> 2400s (config default AND config.yaml).** 15 minutes
cut off real launches that were still booting on Lambda's side; SXM4/large
multi-GPU boots were observed at 15-30+ min. 2400s (40 min) covers the worst
case with headroom. This is a ceiling, not a wait we always incur.

**The boot waiter now survives a backend restart (--reload).** The launch
pipeline runs in an in-memory asyncio task; a `--reload` restart (every
backend file save in dev) killed it mid-boot. The instance kept booting to
'active' on Lambda, but nothing dialed SSH or closed the launch record: it
hung in 'booting' forever while it billed. Fix: `resume_pending_launches()`
runs at startup (after adopt), finds every 'booting' launch, and either marks
it active (if adopt already reconnected the now-live instance) or spawns a
fresh wait-then-connect task. Fresh timeout window on resume is deliberate -
a restart must never SHORTEN a genuine boot, which was the whole bug.
Alternative (persist the coroutine / seed elapsed from launched_at) was
rejected: it risks instantly timing out an instance that is still booting,
reintroducing the failure.

**Server-side long-poll: wait_for_launch (MCP) / GET /launches/{id}/wait.**
An agent polling get_launch_status every few seconds burned ~40 round-trips
(and their tokens) per slow boot. `wait_until_settled` parks server-side up
to a capped timeout (<=300s/call) and returns when the launch settles. It
polls the DB, not the in-memory task, so it also serves resumed launches.
The cap keeps a single HTTP request from hanging forever; a still-booting
caller just calls again.

**Structured launch phase (launch_progress, pure).** Every launch record now
carries a stable `phase` (requesting_capacity | retrying_capacity |
waiting_for_active | ready | failed | terminated), a human `phase_detail`,
`settled`, and while booting a `boot_elapsed/timeout/remaining_seconds`
countdown. Replaces the empty connection_error a poller used to see mid-boot.
The dashboard's Pending-launch card renders the countdown with a note that a
long boot is normal, so a 40-min boot doesn't look frozen.

**Log progress-bar collapse (collapse_progress).** Tools redraw progress bars
with `\r`; captured by newline only, all the intermediate frames arrive glued
into one multi-KB line that a terminal never shows and that burns agent
tokens on read. We now store only the segment after the last `\r` (the
terminal-visible frame), at the single append_log chokepoint. Chose write-
time over a read-time clean=true flag: the raw frames have zero value stored,
and every reader stays clean without opting in.

**Not done: no forced fallback instance type.** The report suggested adding
gpu_1x_a100_sxm4 as a default fallback. Left fallback_instance_types empty:
substituting a different (pricier) type than the user asked for should be
their opt-in, not a shipped default. The config comment shows the example.

**wait_for_launch absorbs a backend restart mid-park (client-side retry).**
Field follow-up: a --reload restart during the long-poll dropped the socket
and the tool surfaced "backend unreachable" for a launch that was actually
fine (the backend resumes it on startup). The MCP tool now distinguishes
transport failure (`unreachable: true` from _call) from backend rejection,
reconnects, and keeps parking inside its own timeout window; if the backend
never answers it returns a calm structured `phase: backend_restarting`
record that says to call again. This retry is transport resilience in a
read-only poll, NOT client-side business logic - no guard is involved. Same
fix also raised the per-request socket timeout above the server park time
(the shared client's 60s default would have cut off a 120s park).

**Terminal sessions survive a page refresh (terminal_sessions.py).** The
dock already kept shells alive across navigation, but the WS handler OWNED
the pty/SSH process, so a refresh (the freeze-then-reload case) killed the
shell and any Claude session running in it. Now the process, its output
pump, and a ~200k-char scrollback buffer live in a TerminalSessionManager
keyed by a client-chosen session id; the dock persists its tabs/layout in
sessionStorage and reconnects with the same ids, so a refresh reattaches
every shell with scrollback replayed. Lifecycle: a bare socket drop
DETACHES (shell keeps running); the tab's x sends {"type":"close"} which
kills; the shell exiting ends it; a detached session is reaped after
hub.terminal_grace_seconds (default 900) so closed-for-good tabs don't
leak shells; backend shutdown kills all. sessionStorage (per-tab, dies
with it) was chosen over localStorage deliberately: refresh = restore,
closing the app = a fresh start, matching the requested scope. No ?session=
param keeps the old ephemeral contract for any other client. Security
posture unchanged: same origin allowlist, same loopback-only listen, the
session layer is transport glue below those checks.

**First-job GPU preflight (dispatcher._ensure_gpu_ready).** Field case: an
A100 SXM4 job dispatched 2.5 min after cloud-init finished died with "No
CUDA GPUs are available" and burned ~5 billed minutes. Cause: on SXM boxes
CUDA cannot initialize until nvidia-fabricmanager finishes starting -
minutes after boot - while nvidia-smi already looks healthy, so every
hand-check passes. The dispatcher now runs `nvidia-smi -q` before the FIRST
job on each instance and waits until the Fabric State line settles
(Completed / absent on PCIe boxes), bounded by
tasks.gpu_ready_timeout_seconds (180s) polling every 10s. Fail-open on
purpose: a probe error or timeout logs an honest line and dispatches anyway
- a wrong probe must never brick dispatch; pre-preflight behavior is the
floor. Readiness is cached per instance in memory only: a backend restart
re-probes once (seconds), which also re-covers an instance that was
mid-boot during the restart. Parsing lives in a pure gpu_readiness()
function tested against captured nvidia-smi output from both phases.

## 2026-07-15 — sdxl-generate uses python3; storage-browse errors made legible

Two field findings from dogfooding the templates on a real A10 (us-west-1),
both on the phase-40 field-hardening branch.

**sdxl-generate ran `python`, but its image only ships `python3`.** The
template's command was `... && exec python -c "$PYCODE" ...`. The
`huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu:latest` image has `/usr/bin/python3`
and no `python` symlink, so every run died with `exec: python: not found`
(exit 127) AFTER pulling the multi-GB image and running pip - real GPU
minutes for a guaranteed failure. Fixed to `python3`. Verified end-to-end on
the A10: two 1024x1024 PNGs written to the persistent filesystem, exit 0.
Only this template was affected - whisper-batch uses `pytorch/pytorch`
(has `python`, proven by the sprite-to-3d field run) and the python:3.11-slim
templates have both. **Alternative considered:** pin the image to a digest so
`:latest` cannot drift again. Deferred - the interpreter fix is the correct
minimal change, and a pinned tag has its own staleness cost (older CUDA); the
comment already flags `:latest` as a pin-later hot-path candidate.

**list_persistent_files crashed with "Expecting value: line 1 column 1".**
The S3 "Files" API keys (separate from the Lambda API key) were empty in
.env, so the storage factory raised ValueError; the `/storage/files` route
let that become a Starlette 500 *plain-text* page; and the MCP `_call` helper
ran `resp.json()` on that plain text, raising an opaque JSON-decode error
that surfaced to the agent. Hardened at both layers: `_storage_for` now
catches the credential ValueError and returns a clear 503 ("...credentials
are not configured in .env"), and `_call` wraps the JSON decode so ANY
non-JSON body (a 500 page, a proxy error) degrades to `{"error": <status /
body text>}` instead of crashing. The decode guard helps every tool, not
just this one. Underlying cause is config, not code: filling the S3 keys in
.env turns the persistent-file browser back on. **Why surface, not silence:**
a guiding LLM that gets "credentials are not configured" can tell the user
what to fix; "Expecting value: line 1 column 1" tells no one anything.

## 2026-07-15 — Launch-target discovery, actionable capacity failures, quieter pull logs

Repair pass on the friction found while dogfooding a launch over MCP: I
guessed a region with no A10 (5 failed attempts), then guessed one where the
user had no filesystem. The backend already knew both facts — capacity per
region (`regions_with_capacity` on each instance type) and region per
filesystem — but nothing put them together or exposed them to an agent.

**`launch_options(types, filesystems)` — a pure cross-reference.** Returns
launchable `{instance_type, region, filesystem}` targets Lambda can satisfy
NOW, ranked: co-located with EXISTING data first (a filesystem with bytes in
that region), then co-located with an empty filesystem, then scratch-only
(capacity but no filesystem there), cheaper first within each band; plus an
`unavailable` list of types with no capacity anywhere. Exposed as
`GET /launch-options` and the MCP tool `list_launch_options`, whose docstring
(and `launch_gpu`'s) tell an agent to call it FIRST and copy a target. A
launch needs type+region+filesystem to line up (types are capacity-gated per
region; filesystems are region-locked), so handing back only combinations
that already line up removes the blind guess. **Why a pure function + thin
route:** same pattern as `launch_progress` / `gpu_readiness` — the ranking is
unit-tested against the mock catalog with no I/O, and the route/tool are
one-liners. **Not changed:** `launch_gpu` still takes explicit args (a spend
action must not auto-pick); discovery informs the choice, it doesn't make it.
The dashboard already greys out impossible regions from `/instance-types`;
wiring a co-located "recommended" picker into the form is a possible
follow-up, not done here.

**Capacity exhaustion now names where to go.** The final "no capacity"
message used to end with "add fallback types in config.yaml" — useless to an
agent that can't edit YAML. `_capacity_hint` (best-effort; a catalog error
just yields no hint, never masks the failure) now appends the regions where
the requested types DO have capacity right now, e.g. "Available right now:
gpu_1x_a10 in us-west-2. Relaunch there ... or call list-launch-options".

**Docker pull churn dropped from stored job logs.** A `docker pull` in
captured (non-TTY) output emits one line per layer per state — dozens of
`<hash>: Waiting / Downloading / Pull complete` that buried the real job
output and burned agent tokens on every `get_job_logs`. `is_docker_pull_noise`
(pure, regex on the `<12-hex>: <verb>` shape) drops them in `append_log`. The
lines that carry signal — `Pulling from ...`, `Digest:`, `Status: Downloaded
...`, and all job output — are NOT matched, and the full docker output still
lands in the per-task log file archived on the instance. Chose drop-at-store
over a stateful collapser: stateless, testable, and the archived file is the
escape hatch if the raw pull is ever needed.

## 2026-07-15 — Keyless agent file browsing: SSH first, S3 only as fallback

The MCP `list_persistent_files` tool browsed ONLY through Lambda's S3 "Files"
API, so an account with no S3 keys in .env (a real user case: they don't have
and won't add them) could not browse persistent files from an agent at all —
even with a box up. But the dashboard's per-instance Files panel browses the
same files over the managed SSH connection through the sidecar, needing no
keys. The tool now uses that path first: if a connected instance mounts the
target filesystem, it browses via `/instances/{id}/files/list` (sidecar, local
-disk speed, no keys) and returns `{source, filesystem, root, path, entries}`;
only when nothing suitable is connected does it fall back to `/storage/files`
(S3, which CAN browse with no instance running but needs keys). When even that
fails for lack of keys, the error carries a `hint` pointing at the keyless
route. `prefix` stays filesystem-relative on both paths — the sidecar's
persistent root is `/lambda/nfs` (the filesystem's parent), so the tool
prepends the filesystem name to the sidecar path to match the S3 semantics.

**Why the tool, not the /storage/files route:** the route is a thin S3 shim
and routes hold no business logic (project rule); the tool is already the
place that composes multiple backend calls (it picks a filesystem, picks an
instance), and choosing WHICH existing guarded endpoint to hit keeps the MCP
client thin without importing backend internals. The dashboard Storage page
(the standalone no-instance browser) still needs S3 keys and now returns the
clean 503 added earlier; wiring its UI toward the per-instance panel when a
box is up is a possible follow-up.

## 2026-07-15 — Terminal freeze: stop forcing a reflow per output chunk

The in-dock terminal froze under output volume (Claude streaming, build logs)
and janked while resizing. All three causes were front-end, not the (sound)
backend session layer:

1. **Per-chunk scrollToBottom.** `ws.onmessage` did
   `term.write(data, () => term.scrollToBottom())` — a synchronous reflow on
   EVERY WebSocket frame, including on hidden tabs. Under a firehose that is
   hundreds of forced layouts a second, which pins the main thread. xterm
   already auto-scrolls on write when the viewport is at the bottom, so the
   callback was redundant; dropping it fixes the freeze AND lets a user scroll
   up to read without being yanked back down.
2. **Unthrottled fit.** The ResizeObserver ran `doFit` (a full `fit.fit()`
   reflow + a PTY resize send) on every animation frame during a resize.
   `doFit` now coalesces to one run per frame and skips the PTY resize unless
   the cols/rows grid actually changed — no more change_terminal_size spam.
3. **Unthrottled drag.** The dock resize handle called setHeight/setWidth on
   every pointermove, re-rendering the dock and firing every terminal's
   ResizeObserver each time. The drag now coalesces to one state update per
   animation frame.

4. **DOM renderer.** xterm's default renderer lays out every cell in the DOM.
   Added `@xterm/addon-webgl` (0.19.0, pairs with xterm 6.0), loaded after
   `term.open()` so it hooks the live renderer, to draw glyphs on the GPU —
   the throughput ceiling-raiser under heavy output. It degrades safely: the
   import is `.catch(() => null)` (a missing/blocked chunk never breaks the
   shell), construction is wrapped in try/catch (no usable WebGL context ->
   stay on the DOM renderer), and `onContextLoss` disposes the addon so a lost
   GPU context reverts to DOM instead of going blank.

## 2026-07-16 — Terminal flow control: the real fix for freeze-under-output

The earlier terminal-perf pass (dropping the per-chunk scrollToBottom reflow,
throttling fit, WebGL) helped but did not stop the freeze: with a full-screen
TUI (Claude Code) streaming, output outran xterm and its write buffer grew
without bound until the tab choked. Diagnosis confirmed by the user: JUST the
terminal froze (rest of the app responsive), under heavy output, not the dev
server / drive. So the missing piece was backpressure.

Watermark flow control end to end:
- The browser acks how many chars it has actually RENDERED (xterm's write
  callback is the "parsed" signal), batched ~8 KB to avoid a message per
  chunk, carrying no scrollToBottom so the reflow stays gone.
- TerminalSession tracks outstanding (sent - acked) chars and a `_writable`
  event: cleared at FLOW_HIGH_WATER (128 KB behind), set again at
  FLOW_LOW_WATER (16 KB). feed() records scrollback FIRST (a reattach always
  replays everything), then sends and accounts — only delivery is paced.
- Each pump calls await_writable() BEFORE reading more, so the pause lands at
  the source: the SSH channel window fills and the remote shell throttles; the
  local pty pump uses a bounded queue that, when full, stops reading the fd so
  the kernel pty buffer backpressures the local shell.
- await_writable() is bounded by FLOW_WAIT_TIMEOUT (5 s): a client that never
  acks (an old cached tab) degrades to unpaced output, never a stalled shell.
  attach/detach reset the accounting so a fresh or absent viewer starts clean.

Chose true backpressure over dropping/coalescing output: a TUI's escape
stream can't be dropped without corrupting the screen, so the producer must
be slowed, not the bytes thinned.

## 2026-07-16 — Rolling-tag drift: surface it, don't force a pin

sdxl-generate broke because its `:latest` base silently dropped the `python`
symlink — image drift, not an authoring error. Several templates ride
floating tags (vllm/sglang `:latest`, axolotl `main-latest`), so the same
class of failure can recur and only shows up after a job burns GPU minutes.

`floating_tag_warning(image)` (pure) flags any unpinned tag: a tag counts as
PINNED when it is a @sha256 digest or contains a digit (a version, e.g.
2.4.0-cuda12.4 or 5.5.0-tf2); a digit-less tag (latest, main, nightly) or no
tag at all floats. It parses the ref carefully so a registry:port on the host
is not mistaken for a tag. The result rides a new non-fatal `warnings` field
on JobTemplate, surfaced three ways: logged at load, returned by
`to_api()` (so `/templates` and MCP `list_templates` carry it), and shown as
an amber advisory under the Jobs-page template picker.

**Surface, not pin:** hard-pinning every image to a digest trades drift for
staleness — a frozen base misses CUDA/security fixes and falls out of step
with the packages a template pip-installs at start — so it stays the author's
call. As a recovery breadcrumb, sdxl-generate records the digest of the image
we VERIFIED on a real A10 (2026-07-15) in a comment, so if a future pull
breaks, pinning to that digest restores a known-good state immediately.

## 2026-07-16 — File-navigator delete on root-owned job outputs

Found while cleaning up the whisper-batch test: job containers write outputs
as root (uid 0) into root-owned directories on the NFS, but the sidecar runs
as `User=ubuntu` (cloud_init.py), so its `/fs/delete` (the dashboard file
navigator's delete) hit "permission denied" on exactly the files a user wants
to clean up — checkpoints, outputs, caches. Silent, confusing break.

Fix: `fs_delete` tries the normal unprivileged remove first (least privilege
for ubuntu-owned files), and only on PermissionError falls back to
`_privileged_remove` — `sudo -n rm -rf -- <path>`. The path is the same
jail-resolved absolute path the handler already validated, passed as a single
argv (no shell) with `--` to stop option parsing, so the escalation stays
confined to the sanctioned roots. `sudo -n` (non-interactive) relies on the
instance's passwordless sudo (Lambda's default, already used by run_command);
if sudo is missing or refuses, the user gets a clear 500, never a hang.

Chose sudo-on-demand over running the whole sidecar as root (keeps least
privilege for everything else) and over running job containers as the host
user (which would break the many templates that need root in-container for
pip/apt and /root/.cache). Ships with the sidecar at launch, so it applies to
newly launched instances.

## 2026-07-16 — "Directory not empty" really means "a job still has it open"

Found live while cleaning the vllm test's HF cache: deleting a directory a
RUNNING job holds open fails on NFS with `rm: cannot remove '.../xet/logs':
Directory not empty`. NFS turns "unlink a file another process still has
open" into a hidden .nfsXXXX placeholder, so the parent then refuses — an
error that reads like a bug rather than "stop the job first".

`_busy_hint()` recognizes that shape (not empty / resource busy / .nfs) and
fs_delete returns 409 (a conflict, retryable) saying what is actually wrong
and what to do, instead of surfacing the raw rm text. Applied on BOTH paths:
the privileged retry and the plain remove — the latter raises OSError, not
PermissionError, so it would otherwise have escaped as a generic 500.

The raw detail is still appended in parens: the hint explains, it never hides
what the OS said.

## 2026-07-16 — Terminal still froze: show the renderer, fix the flow-control valve

The freeze survived the flow-control fix (confirmed with a restarted backend
and a hard-refreshed tab, so the fix WAS live). Two problems, both mine:

**1. The safety valve defeated the mechanism.** `await_writable()` timed out
after 5s and resumed sending. That valve exists for a client that CANNOT ack
(an old tab predating flow control) — but a browser choking on render also
stops acking, so the valve fired exactly when the pause was needed, and the
backend resumed flooding mid-choke. Now the budget depends on evidence: a
client that has NEVER acked gets FLOW_WAIT_TIMEOUT (5s, then stream unpaced —
no stall); a client that HAS acked demonstrably speaks the protocol and is
merely busy, so it gets FLOW_BUSY_TIMEOUT (60s), long enough for a real
render backlog. The long bound still exists only so a browser that dies
without closing its socket cannot wedge the shell forever; a timeout there
now logs a warning instead of passing silently. attach() resets the ack count
because a new viewer's protocol support is unknown again.

**2. A silent fallback hid the likeliest cause.** WebGL init was wrapped in a
bare `except`/`.catch(() => null)`, so if the GPU renderer never took (no
context, blocklisted GPU, too many live contexts across dock tabs), the panel
quietly ran xterm's much slower DOM renderer — indistinguishable from "the
fix didn't work". The active renderer is now state, shown in the panel header
(`webgl` grey / `dom` amber) with the reason logged to the console. Version
pairing was checked and is correct (xterm 6.0 / fit 0.11 / webgl 0.19), so
this is instrumentation to END the guessing, not a suspected mismatch.

Lesson: an error path that swallows its reason turns one bug into two.

## 2026-07-16 — The terminal glitch was a resize dedup that never sent

Symptom: typed text wrapped back over the start of its own line, the input
box kept stale text, and stretching the dock ("jiggling") fixed it. Not the
renderer: it reproduced identically with ?renderer=dom, which exonerated
WebGL after the header confirmed webgl was live.

Cause, introduced by my own resize-throttling pass: doFit updated
lastCols/lastRows BEFORE checking that the socket was open. The first fit
runs while the WebSocket is still CONNECTING (ResizeObserver fires on
observe), so it recorded the size and skipped the send; when ws.onopen ran
doFit again, the dims matched lastCols/lastRows and it returned early. The
resize was therefore NEVER sent, leaving the pty at its 80x24 default while
the view was much wider. The app wrapped at column 80 and overwrote its own
line; any real resize sent a fresh size and resynced it, which is exactly why
jiggling "fixed" it.

Fix: lastCols/lastRows mean "the size the pty has actually been TOLD", so
they are only updated on a successful send - the readyState check now comes
BEFORE the dedup. Lesson: a cache of "what the peer knows" must never be
written on a path that did not tell the peer.

## 2026-07-17 — Restart-proof jobs: detached containers + task re-adoption

Live hardening pass found the worst backend bug yet: a backend restart
(--reload on every file save) mid-job first ORPHANED the task (logs frozen,
'running' forever), and on the second live test actually KILLED the
container (exit 141, SIGPIPE): the docker client piped into the SSH channel,
so the channel's death took the job with it.

Fix, two layers:
- wrap_remote_command now runs the container DETACHED (nohup, output to the
  persistent task log, never the SSH pipe) and writes its exit code to
  task-logs/<id>.exit; the streaming session just tails the log and waits
  for the exit file. Any session death only kills the tail. nohup over
  setsid because macOS has no setsid and the wrapper tests execute in a
  real shell.
- Dispatcher._readopt_running_tasks() (startup): every 'running' task is
  re-adopted; poll the exit file (fallbacks: docker inspect for old-wrap
  containers, honest 'result unknown' if both are gone) and finish with the
  real code. Verified live: restart at tick 12/60, container survived all
  60 ticks, task landed succeeded/exit 0.

Also verified live in the same pass: idle termination fired at exactly the
configured limit and its rescue synced 22 MB of planted valuable files to
ephemeral-backup/ before terminating (audit: idle_termination ->
sync_ephemeral -> data_rescue), and the auto-manage lifecycle ran
launch -> run -> sync -> terminate with zero human input.

## 2026-07-17 — Terminal UX pass: lost cursor, Shift+Enter, font size, overflow

Four issues from field use inside the dock terminal (screenshots in the
user's Mani-Terminal-Bugs folder):

- **Typing over the current line / lost cursor.** Output arriving while the
  viewport was scrolled up left the user typing "blind" below the fold;
  typing now snaps the view to the cursor (term.scrollToBottom in onData,
  once per keystroke, cheap), and a full term.refresh follows every real
  grid change: the manual "jiggle the handle" fix, automated.
- **Shift+Enter sends instead of newline.** Terminals cannot distinguish
  Shift+Enter from Enter on the wire, so the key handler sends
  backslash+CR: the escaped-newline form the Claude CLI understands, and
  plain line continuation in every shell.
- **Font size.** Cmd/Ctrl +/-/0 while the terminal is focused (8-24px,
  persisted in localStorage, refit + PTY resize after each change).
- **Instance-card buttons flying off the card.** When the action row
  overflows, the four dock buttons collapse into a ">>" menu (Terminate
  always stays visible). Hysteresis - remember the width the full row
  needed, expand only when it is back - prevents collapse/expand flicker.

## 2026-07-17 — Second GPU boot race: container runtime, not the host

Gamemaker field pass: a job dispatched ~100s after active died with "No CUDA
GPUs are available" DESPITE the fabric-manager preflight - host nvidia-smi
was fine; the NVIDIA container toolkit wasn't serving GPUs yet. Two layers:

- GPU_PROBE_COMMAND now also runs `nvidia-container-cli info` (the library
  docker's --gpus path uses), guarded by `command -v` so a box without the
  toolkit stays fail-open.
- Last resort: a container that exits nonzero with a CUDA-race signature
  ("No CUDA GPUs are available", "could not select device driver", ...) is
  retried ONCE after re-running the readiness gate. Ordinary failures are
  never retried (exit code preserved).

Also from that pass: the no-S3-keys 503 for /storage/files now teaches the
keyless route (instance Files panel / list_persistent_files over SSH), so
"no instance = blind filesystem" at least explains itself.

## 2026-07-17 — Capacity watches: full region map, and the notification that wasn't

Field QA on the watches panel found two real problems and a research answer:

**The region picker showed ~5 regions.** It was built from regions with
CURRENT capacity (plus filesystem regions) - exactly backwards for a watch,
whose point is a region with no capacity right now. It now offers the full
region universe from /regions, annotated per selected GPU with "has capacity
now". REGION_NAMES gained the international regions from the console picker
(Germany, Israel, India, Osaka, Tokyo, Sydney); NA_REGIONS renamed
KNOWN_REGIONS to match.

**A watch without auto-launch notified nobody.** The dispatcher's
on_capacity_available hook existed but was never wired to anything, so
capacity flipped the card to "available" silently. _check_watches now posts
a real notification (new kind: capacity_available, togglable in Settings,
default on) saying whether it auto-launched or the user should hurry.

**"Which regions can ever carry which GPU?"** Researched: Lambda publishes
no static per-type region roster - even their status page labels regions
inconsistently - and the API only reports CURRENT capacity per type. So we
deliberately do NOT hardcode a matrix (a guess presented as fact); the
picker says what is true now and the form copy says a watch in a region
that never carries the type will never fire.

Known flake noted: test_full_task_and_idle_lifecycle intermittently fails
under full-suite load only (timing); passes in isolation every time.

## 2026-07-17 — Cancel any job (servers included) + stale-default migration

Two gaps found while running the distill loop live:

**Cancel was auto-manage-only.** /tasks/{id}/cancel rejected manual jobs, so
a vllm-serve started from the Jobs page could not be stopped through
Manifold at all - the distill guide's own serve-then-train flow needed a
hand-rolled `docker stop` over SSH. dispatcher.cancel_task now covers every
pre-terminal state: queued settles as cancelled; running gets its container
stopped on the instance (`docker rm -f`, with a bracket-trick pkill for jobs
still in image-pull where no container exists yet); auto-managed pre-run
routes to the existing guarded teardown, and a running auto-managed job's
lifecycle sees the settle and proceeds to sync + terminate on its own. The
completion funnel labels a requested stop "cancelled by user" (no failure
ping) instead of a baffling "container exited 137". Jobs-page button now
shows Stop on running jobs.

**Shipped-default fixes never reached existing installs.** The packaged app
seeds DATA_ROOT/config.yaml once and never overwrites it (user-owned), so
the 900->2400 boot-timeout fix silently did not apply to the desktop app -
found live when a distill launch ran under a 900s window that a slow SXM
boot could overrun. CONFIG_MIGRATIONS rewrites a value ONLY while it still
exactly equals the old shipped default (a user-chosen value never matches),
via line-level regex so comments survive; applied and persisted in
load_settings with a log line per migration. Alternative considered: a
defaults-overlay (load bundled config underneath the user file) - rejected
because the seeded file is a full copy, so every key would read as a user
choice and nothing would ever migrate.

**Instance adoption runs on a sweep, not just at startup.** An instance
launched outside Manifold (Lambda console, a raw API script, an agent with
its own credentials) appeared in Running Instances - the list comes from
Lambda's API - but had no managed SSH connection, so Files, model chat, and
jobs were all dead for it until the backend restarted. Found live when an
agent drove a launch with curl and then sat stuck. The dispatcher now calls
adopt_running_instances every launch.adopt_poll_seconds (default 30, 0
disables); the call already skips tracked ids, so steady state is one
list_instances per tick. Mid-session adoptions audit as "instance_adopted"
(reconnect_on_startup stays what it says). Alternative considered: a manual
Connect button on the instance card - rejected because the user cannot know
a connection is missing before clicking around a dead Files panel, which is
exactly how this was found.

**Adopted external instances default to keep-alive.** The adoption sweep
made externally-launched boxes fully usable (Files/chat/jobs) - and thereby
put them on the idle termination clock, where they are guaranteed to look
idle: their owner's activity happens over their own SSH, which the idle
tracker cannot see. Found live 25 minutes before Manifold would have
rescued-and-terminated an agent's box mid-extraction. Rule: no launch row
(Manifold did not launch it) -> keep-alive defaults ON at adoption, audited,
visible on the instance card, user can switch it off; the default applies
once per instance id so that choice is never overridden by the next sweep
tick. A backend restart re-applies the default (errs toward keeping an
externally-owned box alive; the cost of a wrong guess is a few $/hr, the
cost of the other wrong guess is someone's running job). Alternative
considered: exempting external instances from the idle loop entirely -
rejected because it removes the user's ability to opt a forgotten external
box INTO cost protection.

**GPU telemetry falls back to nvidia-smi over SSH.** The telemetry chart
and sampling loop rode the sidecar exclusively - which only exists on
instances Manifold launched, because OUR cloud-init installs it. Adopted
external boxes therefore showed "telemetry unavailable" forever. Now the
sidecar is tried first (richer, cheaper, streaming), and when it raises,
metrics come from nvidia-smi --query-gpu over the managed SSH connection
in the same payload shape (marked source: "ssh"), in all three consumers:
the 30s sampling loop, GET /metrics, and the chart's WS relay (3s poll).
Alternative considered: installing the sidecar onto adopted boxes over
SSH - rejected for now because mutating a machine Manifold does not own
is a bigger decision than reading nvidia-smi from it.

**Model-fit preflight estimates from the name, not the weights.** The
Jobs page now warns before launch when a model's weights plausibly exceed
the chosen GPU's VRAM (born from a 27B GPTQ-Int4 checkpoint OOMing a
24 GB A10 after the full boot + download tax was paid). Parameter count
and quantization are parsed from the model id (27B, 8x7B, GPTQ/AWQ/Int4,
fp8, q4...), VRAM from the instance type; verdict tiers fits / tight
(weights above 70% of VRAM leave little KV-cache room) / no (above 92%).
Advisory only, never blocks, and the copy says it was estimated from the
name. Alternative considered: querying the HF API for real safetensors
sizes - rejected for v1 because it adds a network dependency and auth
surface to a pure function, and the name heuristic catches the whole
class of mistake this exists to catch; unknown names simply say nothing.

**Agent onboarding is a served document, not tribal knowledge.** An agent
with every Manifold MCP tool available still drove the raw Lambda API and
lost a night to self-inflicted terminations, because nothing taught it the
product. docs/manifold-skill.md is the playbook (recipes + rules), served
at /skill, bundled into the frozen backend, exposed as the MCP get_skill
tool, and the MCP server instructions tell agents to read it first. One
source file, four delivery paths, so it cannot drift.

**CLI brain detection searches well-known dirs, not just PATH.** Finder
launches give a macOS app launchd's bare PATH, so shutil.which found no
frontier CLI and the packaged app showed "No brains found" to a user
logged into all three. Detection falls back to /opt/homebrew/bin,
/usr/local/bin, ~/.local/bin, ~/.npm-global/bin, ~/.bun/bin, ~/bin.
Invocation already used the resolved absolute path. Alternative
considered: spawning a login shell to read the user's real PATH -
rejected as slower, shell-dependent, and a bigger surface than a static
list of the six places these CLIs actually install to.

**MCP presence is shown as recent activity, not a connection.** The MCP
bridge is a stateless HTTP thin client, so a "connected" badge would be
a lie waiting to happen. Every MCP call already lands in the audit log
with actor "mcp"; the header chip derives from the newest such row: teal
within 5 minutes (an agent is working), grey within the hour, hidden
after that. Honest, zero new state, click-through to Activity.
