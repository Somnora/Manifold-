# Driving Manifold from an AI agent (MCP setup)

The MCP server lets any MCP-capable client — Claude Desktop, Claude Code,
or anything else that speaks the protocol — launch GPUs, run jobs, browse
storage, and shut instances down. Every tool call flows through the same
guarded backend as the dashboard: the budget cap, the concurrency limit,
the region check, and the termination safety hook all apply identically.
An agent cannot spend what you have not permitted.

## Prerequisites

The backend must be running (the desktop app, or in a dev checkout
`uv run uvicorn app.main:create_default_app --factory` from `backend/`,
or mock mode with `MANIFOLD_MOCK=1`). The MCP server is a thin bridge to
it; if the backend is down, every tool returns a clear "backend
unreachable" error.

## From the installed desktop app (no dev checkout)

The app's bundled backend binary doubles as the MCP server: run it with
`--mcp` and it speaks MCP on stdio, bridging to the running app. On macOS
the binary lives inside the app bundle, so registering in Claude Code is
one command:

```bash
claude mcp add manifold -- "/Applications/Manifold.app/Contents/MacOS/manifold-backend" --mcp
```

Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "manifold": {
      "command": "/Applications/Manifold.app/Contents/MacOS/manifold-backend",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Keep the Manifold app running: the bridge talks to it on
localhost:8000 (or MANIFOLD_PORT if you changed it; set the same value in
the MCP server's env). Everything below about dev-checkout registration
still works and behaves identically - it is the same bridge.

## Registering in Claude Code

From the repo root:

```bash
claude mcp add manifold -- uv run --directory "$(pwd)/backend" manifold-mcp
```

Then in any Claude Code session in this project: "launch a 1x A10 in
us-east-1 with the manifold-data filesystem" and watch it use the tools.

## Registering in Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(create the file if it does not exist), with YOUR absolute repo path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "manifold": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/Users/jamesmcshane/Desktop/Manifold/backend", "manifold-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop; the tools appear under the hammer icon.

If the backend runs somewhere non-default, set the env var in the same
block: `"env": {"MANIFOLD_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000"}`.

## Registering in Codex

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`, with YOUR absolute repo path:

```toml
[mcp_servers.manifold]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "--directory", "/Users/you/Manifold/backend", "manifold-mcp"]
```

Then in any codex session: "use the manifold tools to launch an A10 and
run gpu-smoke". Tell it once per task: **use the manifold tools, not ssh**
- that is what keeps every action on the audit trail.

## Registering in Gemini CLI

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json` (create it if needed):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "manifold": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/Users/you/Manifold/backend", "manifold-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

`/mcp` inside gemini lists the tools once it connects.

## The tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_launch_options()` | Ranked {type, region, filesystem} targets that have capacity NOW, co-located with your data first — call before `launch_gpu` |
| `launch_gpu(instance_type, region, filesystem, connection_mode?)` | Launch through ALL guards; returns a launch id |
| `get_launch_status(launch_id)` | One snapshot: phase + boot countdown while it boots |
| `wait_for_launch(launch_id, timeout=120)` | Block until active/failed instead of polling (best for slow SXM4 boots) |
| `list_instances()` | Live instances + SSH connection state |
| `terminate_instance(id, force=false)` | force=false returns the unsaved-file list instead of terminating |
| `sync_outputs(instance_id)` | rsync ephemeral scratch → persistent filesystem |
| `list_templates()` | Job templates with parameter schemas |
| `run_job(template, parameters)` | Enqueue a job; validated immediately |
| `get_job_status(id)` / `get_job_logs(id, tail=100)` | Progress and live logs |
| `list_filesystems()` / `list_persistent_files(prefix)` | Persistent storage; browses over SSH (no S3 keys) when a box is up, else via the S3 Files API |
| `upload_file(local_path, remote_path)` | Push a file from this machine to the instance (SFTP) |
| `download_file(remote_path, local_path)` | Pull results back to this machine (SFTP) |
| `run_command(instance_id, command, timeout=120)` | ONE shell command on the instance, audited with its exit code |
| `save_template(yaml_text)` / `delete_template(name)` | Author a custom job template (see docs/custom-templates.md) |

Every tool takes an optional `note` — one line of intent that lands in the
audit log. Everything an agent does is visible live on the dashboard's
**Activity → Audit trail** page (filter: Agent actions), and any job it
queues appears on the Jobs page with streaming logs.

## Worked example

You say to the agent:

> Transcribe everything in /inbox with whisper-large, then shut down.

A well-behaved session looks like this (all of it visible on Agent
Activity):

1. `list_templates(note="find transcription template")` → sees
   `whisper-batch` with parameters `input_dir`, `model_size`, `language`.
2. `list_launch_options(note="where can I launch, near my data")` → the top
   target is `gpu_1x_a10` in `us-east-1` on `manifold-data` (co-located with
   the inbox, and available right now), so no region is guessed blind.
3. `launch_gpu(instance_type="gpu_1x_a10", region="us-east-1",
   filesystem="manifold-data", note="GPU for whisper batch")` → launch id.
   If this had breached the budget or concurrency cap, the tool would have
   returned the guard's message and the agent would have to tell you no.
4. `get_launch_status(...)` polled until `active`.
5. `run_job("whisper-batch", {"input_dir": "inbox", "model_size":
   "large-v3"}, note="transcribe inbox")` → task id.
6. `get_job_status(...)` until `succeeded`; `get_job_logs(...)` to confirm;
   outputs recorded under `<filesystem>/transcripts`.
7. `terminate_instance(id, note="job done")` → **blocked**: the safety hook
   reports unsaved files in ephemeral scratch and the tool returns the list
   instead of terminating.
8. `sync_outputs(id, note="save outputs first")` →
   `terminate_instance(id, force=true, note="all synced")` → terminated.
   Billing stopped.

## Do agents get everything SSH would give them?

Yes — the difference is not capability, it is visibility.

- `run_command` is full shell parity: anything an agent could type over
  raw SSH, it can run through the tool. The difference is that every
  command lands in the audit log with its exit code, and activity resets
  the idle clock so the box is not reaped mid-task.
- Long-running work belongs in `run_job` (or a custom template): jobs
  stream logs to the dashboard, survive backend restarts, and record
  their outputs.
- What agents can NOT do through the tools: bypass a guard. Budget,
  concurrency, the mount jail, and the termination data rescue bind every
  tool identically. Raw SSH from your own terminal could sidestep the
  audit trail — which is exactly why the one instruction worth giving
  every agent is: **use the manifold tools, not ssh**.

## Non-MCP agents

Anything that can speak HTTP can use the backend directly — the API the
MCP tools wrap is plain REST on localhost:8000 (see `backend/app/main.py`).
The guards live in the backend, so they hold for those clients too.
