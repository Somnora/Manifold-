"""Desktop entrypoint: the whole product as one process.

This is what PyInstaller freezes into the sidecar binary the Tauri shell
spawns (and what a double-click runs standalone). It boots the same app
factory as development, binds strictly to loopback, and serves the bundled
dashboard at /.

`manifold-backend --mcp` runs the MCP stdio bridge instead of the server,
so an MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) can drive Manifold with
ONLY the installed app - no dev checkout, no uv. The bridge is the same
HTTP-only thin client as `uv run manifold-mcp`; it needs the app (or any
backend) already running to answer.

MANIFOLD_MOCK=1 works here exactly as in development - the packaged app can
be demoed with zero credentials and zero spend.
