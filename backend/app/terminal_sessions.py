"""Terminal sessions that survive their WebSocket.

The dock already keeps shells alive across page NAVIGATION (panels stay
mounted), but a browser refresh tears the whole page down: the WS drops,
and the shell died with it because the connection handler owned the
process. So a frozen tab + refresh meant setting up Claude in the
terminal all over again.

Now the process, its output pump, and a scrollback buffer live here,
keyed by a client-chosen session id. The dashboard reconnects with the
same id after a refresh, the scrollback is replayed, and the shell
carries on - whatever was running in it never noticed. A session ends
when:

- the user closes its tab (the client sends {"type": "close"}),
- the shell itself exits,
- nothing reattaches within the grace window (a tab that was closed
  outright, not refreshed - otherwise every closed tab would leak a
  live shell), or
- the backend shuts down.

This module is transport-glue only: it never decides WHAT may run a
shell (the endpoints in main.py keep their origin checks and the
managed-connection requirement).
