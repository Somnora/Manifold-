"""ModelClient: talk to a model served ON an instance (e.g. by vllm-serve).

Same seam pattern as SidecarClient: an interface with a real implementation
that rides an SSH local port forward on the managed connection, and a mock
for tests/mock mode. The served model's API (vLLM's OpenAI-compatible
server) listens on 127.0.0.1 on the instance — the dispatcher publishes
template ports loopback-only — so the ONLY path to it is the managed
connection. Nothing new listens anywhere.

    browser chat panel
        -> backend POST /instances/{id}/chat   (SSE relay)
        -> SSH local port forward (managed connection)
        -> 127.0.0.1:<port> on the instance    (vLLM /v1/chat/completions)
