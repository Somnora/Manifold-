"""Cost + utilization intelligence, derived from data Manifold already keeps.

Pure functions only — no I/O, no clock, no DB. Callers pass in the rows they
read from SQLite; these turn them into money-facing estimates and post-run
verdicts. Keeping this side-effect-free makes the estimation math and the
right-size threshold trivially testable (see test_estimates.py) and keeps it
safely off the launch path.

Two jobs:
  1. estimate_job(...)        — pre-launch "≈ 40 min · ~$0.85", confidence-tagged
  2. utilization_summary(...) — post-run "A10, 45 min · peak 9/24 GB · avg 14%"
