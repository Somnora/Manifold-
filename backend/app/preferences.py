"""User preferences: the policies you can change from the Settings page.

Three sources of truth, kept strictly apart (see CLAUDE.md):
- .env         secrets. Never here.
- config.yaml  tunables shipped with the app; supplies the DEFAULTS below.
- preferences  the user's own runtime choices, stored in SQLite.

config.yaml is a file a person edits with an editor and comments; a UI must
not rewrite it (it would eat the comments and the ordering). So the Settings
page writes here instead, and a stored preference overrides the config
default. Anything the user never touched simply falls through to config.

Three policies live here, and they exist for one reason: an UNATTENDED run
must be safe with nobody watching.

approvals    which agent actions pause for a human Approve/Deny.
notifications  what pings you, so a pause is not a silent stall.
data_safety  what happens to files on an instance when it is torn down.

    An instance's scratch disk dies with the instance. Manifold already
    refuses to terminate while valuable unpersisted files exist (the Phase 3
    safety hook), but "refuse" is only a good answer when a human is
    watching: an autopilot run at 3am would just leave the GPU billing.

    So termination now RESCUES first, then re-checks. Two independent
    questions, deliberately not collapsed into one menu:

      WHERE does the data go?   to_filesystem (the Lambda persistent volume,
                                a datacenter-local rsync, effectively free)
                                and/or to_local (down the SSH connection to
                                this machine, which costs real transfer time).
      WHAT is worth rescuing?   scope: "all" unpersisted files, or "outputs"
                                only (files under outputs/ — what jobs write
                                as their deliverable, not multi-GB checkpoints
                                and caches).

    And the one the four-option menu misses: WHAT IF THE RESCUE FAILS.
    if_unsaveable decides between the data and the wallet when a file could
    not be saved (no filesystem attached, transfer budget exhausted, SSH
    down): "block" keeps the instance alive with the files intact and pings
    you; "terminate" stops the billing and lets the files die. Default is
    block, because data loss is unrecoverable and a billing hour is not.
