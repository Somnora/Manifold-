"""Launch orchestration: validation -> guards -> retry -> persistence -> connection.

This module is the single path to a running instance. Every client — the
dashboard, the MCP server (Phase 6), anything else — goes through
Orchestrator.request_launch, so the guards here cannot be bypassed.

Control flow for a launch:

1. VALIDATE   connection mode is available; instance type exists; the
              filesystem exists and its region matches the requested region
              (filesystems are region-locked and attach only at launch).
2. GUARDS     max concurrent instances, then max hourly spend, both computed
              against LIVE instances from the Lambda API. Violations reject
              the request with 409 — nothing is ever queued silently.
3. PERSIST    a launches row is created; every later transition (retrying,
              booting, active, failed) updates it, so the dashboard can
              always show what is happening. The API returns 202 here.
4. RETRY      in the background: one "attempt" tries the requested type and
              then each budget-safe fallback type once. Capacity errors move
              to the next candidate; any other error fails the launch
              immediately. Between attempts: exponential backoff, capped.
5. BOOT       poll the instance until it is "active" with an IP (or time out).
6. CONNECT    ask the launch's ConnectionManager for the dial target (the
              only mode-specific step) and start a ManagedConnection, which
              keeps itself alive with reconnect+backoff from then on.
