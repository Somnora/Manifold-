"""Mock-mode isolation (incident 2026-07-17): a mock backend swapped
fixture state under a live agent session mid-launch. Three guarantees now:

1. Mock mode REFUSES to start while the real database records launches
   that may still have paying instances behind them.
2. Mock fixture state lives in its own database file - it can never read
   or rewrite real rows.
3. Fixture data is self-identifying: agent-facing listings carry
   "mock": true, so no one has to spot a TEST-NET IP to detect demo mode.
