"""The pre-termination data rescue and safety hook, end to end over HTTP.

Phase 37 changed this contract deliberately. Termination used to REFUSE while
valuable files sat on the instance's scratch disk; now it RESCUES them first
(per the data-safety policy) and only refuses if something could not be saved.
Refusing was the right answer with a human watching and the wrong one at 3am,
when an unattended run would just leave the GPU billing against a 409.
